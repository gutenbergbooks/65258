<br />GOD HATH SPOKEN</h2>
<p>Each author has his own individual literary style
and critics of literature can identify the work of an
author by the construction and diction of his writing.
The Holy Spirit is the author of the Bible and
he has a literary style peculiar to himself, which distinguishes
his work from that of all human authors.
There are certain literary characteristics in the Bible
that are not found in any book written by man. It
would be profitable to list a great number of them
and show how they distinguish the Bible from every
other book in the world.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s literary
style is the use of very long sentences, one of
which I shall read for our text this morning. It is
the opening sentence of the book of Hebrews: &ldquo;God,
who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in
these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds; who being the brightness of his
glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding
all things by the word of his power, when he
had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so
much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>That is the reading of four verses but just one sentence.
It is not easy to write such a long sentence that
is easily understood, but this one is perfectly clear.
If some high-school student were called upon to analyze
this sentence and to underscore its principal
clause, he would underscore these words, &ldquo;<i>God hath
spoken</i>.&rdquo; These three words, &ldquo;<i>God hath spoken</i>,&rdquo; are
the principal clause in this long sentence, and they
express a very wonderful and a very profound truth.
If you will just remember these three words and let
them dwell in your heart, meditating upon them
both day and night, the fullness of their meaning
will unfold to you more and more as the days go by.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">God Hath SPOKEN</span></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing that God hath spoken. Just
try to imagine what condition this world would be
in if God had never spoken. What if he had not
spoken to Adam, to Noah, to Moses, or to any of our
forefathers down through the centuries?</p>
<p>As a clue to the conditions which would prevail if
God had not spoken, consider the places on earth
today where the Bible is unknown; where its influence
has had only a very remote and indirect effect.
In such places we find backwardness, ignorance,
disease, darkness. By way of contrast, you may consider
our own country where the Bible is better
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
known; though far from being fully and faithfully
followed. Here we have an effective system of public
education, industrial and scientific advancement,
a comparatively high degree of intelligence, numerous
charitable organizations and institutions, or what
may be summarily described as a high standard of
civilization.</p>
<p>If such material blessings come to those who even
partially respect the word that God has spoken, just
think how wonderful its influence would be if every
individual were a faithful student and faithful follower
of his word. The word that God has spoken
<i>makes a difference</i>! If it were not for his word, we
would be in total darkness. &ldquo;It is not in man that
walketh to direct his own steps.&rdquo; The learned Grecian
philosophers, with all of their wisdom, were not able
to figure out a way of life that would lead to happiness
on this earth, to say nothing of leading to salvation
in that world which is to come. If God had not
spoken, we would not know where we came from, we
would not know where we are going, and we would
not know what to do in the meantime. We owe all of
our progress, not only spiritually but otherwise also,
to the fact that God hath spoken. Oh, we could learn
from the material universe that God is; we could
learn that some sort of a great being had brought into
existence all of the things we behold but if God
had not spoken, we would not know his will concerning
us. We would not know what he wants us to
do. We would not know about the Way that leads to
happiness here and hereafter. So I want you to meditate
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
upon the fact that God hath spoken. I believe
that that meditation will beget within you a feeling
of gratitude for God&rsquo;s word, a greater appreciation
of it, and, therefore, a more careful study of it and
a more diligent adherence unto it.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">GOD Hath Spoken</span></h3>
<p>Every word in our principal clause is significant.
Not only is it important that God hath <i>spoken</i>,
but it is important that <i>God</i> hath spoken&mdash;that <i>God</i>
is the one who has done the speaking. Just think
what that means! The great God of this universe,
creator of heaven and earth and everything therein&mdash;God,
who sprinkled the heavens with teeming millions
of bright sparkling worlds, which we behold by
night, and made these bodies of ours that are so wonderfully
and fearfully constructed&mdash;God, who has all
power and wisdom, and who is characterized by love,
mercy, and tenderness&mdash;God, the everlasting God,
hath spoken. God, the Holy and Living God of all
the universe, hath condescended to speak unto us
who are mere worms of the dust.</p>
<p>Sometimes we see a man on this earth who thinks
himself too good to speak to some other man. Some
folk will not speak to each other. We ought to stop
and consider the fact that God hath spoken to us.
Just think about how great he is, how holy he is, how
pure he is, how powerful he is, and yet he condescended
to speak unto us, who are weak and sinful
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
creatures of earth! He wants us to hear him that we
may enjoy the blessings that come from learning and
obeying the word that he has spoken.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">God HATH Spoken</span></h3>
<p>But the other word in our text is also important&mdash;the
word &ldquo;hath.&rdquo; It is present perfect tense. It means
that God has already spoken. Our text does not say
that God is continuing to speak but that God <i>hath</i>
spoken, indicating that at the time this fact was recorded
God&rsquo;s revelation to the world through Christ
had already been made. It had not all been put in
written form, but the gospel had already been revealed.
It was already in existence among men. The
apostles had already been preaching for a number
of years. At the time they finished committing the
gospel to writing (about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 96), it could truthfully
be said that revelation was already complete.</p>
<p>Our text does not say &ldquo;God is speaking,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God
continues to speak,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God will speak,&rdquo; but &ldquo;God
<i>hath</i> spoken.&rdquo; Of course, as far as you and I are individually
concerned, as we read and study his word,
we are still hearing his message. But the point is that
that message was completely delivered unto the
world nearly two thousand years ago. No additions
have been made to it since then and no addition will
ever be made to it. God <i>hath</i> spoken. His message is
complete. It is, therefore, final. Those who claim a
later revelation are making a false claim. Those who
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
are waiting for a future revelation are waiting in
vain. This very simple clause with just three words
in it indicates that God&rsquo;s message to us through
Christ is complete. God <i>hath</i> spoken. This being
true, we need not expect another revelation.</p>
<p>This truth is further emphasized by other statements
in the Bible. For instance, in 2 Timothy,
chapter 3, and beginning with verse 16, &ldquo;All scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness; that the man of God may be
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;
Or, as one version says, &ldquo;that the man of God may
be complete, furnished completely unto every good
work.&rdquo; So the word God hath spoken is complete. It&rsquo;s
all we need. It furnishes the man of God completely
unto every good work. Therefore, we need not expect
any further revelation.</p>
<p>Notice the word &ldquo;scripture.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;scripture&rdquo;
means that which has been written. The word
that God hath spoken has been put in written form.
We no longer receive it from the lips of the apostles,
or from the lips of those who first proclaimed it unto
the world. After God had spoken through them, they
put his word in writing and it has been passed down
to us through the ages that have followed. By the
providence of God it has been translated into our
own mother tongue so that we may read it and study
it for ourselves. Our testimony then is not an oral
one, but a written one.</p>
<p>In the 20th chapter of John, verses 30 and 31, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
read, &ldquo;And many other signs, truly did Jesus in the
presence of his disciples, which are not written in
this book; but these are written, that ye might believe.&rdquo;
Notice that word &ldquo;written.&rdquo; The source of
our faith has been put in written form. This fact refutes
the claim that God is speaking directly to people
today. He <i>hath</i> spoken. His word has already
been delivered.</p>
<p>During my recent meetings in Georgia and North
Carolina, I heard two men say that God had spoken
to them audibly. One man said he was passing
through a pine thicket one day and God spoke to him.
I asked him what God said to him. He replied, &ldquo;God
told me I needed a saviour.&rdquo; Well, God had already
told him that, two thousand years ago. We have that
revealed in the Bible. I have never talked to a man
who could tell me what God had said to him unless
he got it from the Bible. When a man thinks he hears
God speak today, if anyone honestly thinks such a
thing, he is simply recalling something that he has
read in the Bible, or learned from somebody else who
read it in the Bible. God&rsquo;s message was completely
delivered nearly two thousand years ago. Thus it is
seen that every word of our topic is important. The
Almighty God hath already spoken unto us.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Study the Bible</span></h3>
<p>Now I want to draw a few conclusions from this
great fact. In view of the fact that God has spoken,
let us consider how we ought to study his word. Just
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
think&mdash;it&rsquo;s a message from God, a message from
Heaven! It applies to you, personally and individually,
just as much as it would if he were to speak to
you this morning in audible tones and address you
by name. Suppose, for example, he should call you
by name and say, &ldquo;Now why tarriest thou? Arise and
be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on the
name of the Lord.&rdquo; Why, I believe you would hasten
to do it. But friends, he has already said it. In Acts
22:16, we find those very words and they are written
to you.</p>
<p>Notice again this sentence, &ldquo;God hath spoken unto
<i>us</i>.&rdquo; His words are addressed to us and they apply to
you and me. Every word in the will of Christ, the
new testament or covenant, applies to us, and we
ought to regard it as a personal message from God
Almighty unto us. Surely that thought ought to inspire
us to read the Bible every day. I don&rsquo;t believe
anyone who has any regard for his own welfare and
any respect for Jehovah, can meditate upon the fact
that God hath spoken without being moved to study
God&rsquo;s word more diligently. God hath revealed to us
his word. Therefore, we ought to read it and study it.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">God&rsquo;s Word Is Final</span></h3>
<p>Furthermore, friends, we ought to regard it as
final and complete and as the standard of truth, the
standard by which all of our religious questions are
to be decided. This conclusion is fundamental and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
very important. It needs to be emphasized. If you
talk to the people of this world and see how many
different human standards they are relying upon,
you can see the importance of settling all religious
questions by the divine standard, the word that God
hath spoken through Christ.</p>
<p>I want to use a simple illustration. Suppose three
men measure the length of this room and one of
them uses a yardstick 35 inches long, another uses a
yardstick 36 inches long and the other a yardstick
37 inches long. They won&rsquo;t get the same answer because
they are not using the same standard. The same
is true in the field of philosophy and religion. If each
man uses a different yardstick, nothing but confusion
and division can possibly be the result.</p>
<p>And, friends, that is just exactly what is wrong
with this world today. One man uses the &ldquo;Pope&rdquo; at
Rome for his yardstick. He says that whatever the
&ldquo;Pope&rdquo; says is right. He measures everything by that.
Then I come along and measure by the Bible, the
Word of God, and he and I get different answers.
Somebody else takes the church to which he belongs
as his standard of measurement. People say, &ldquo;My
church teaches so and so,&rdquo; and &ldquo;My church practices
so and so.&rdquo; I have even had them come to me and
say, &ldquo;What does your church believe on this point?
What does your church teach here?&rdquo; They simply
mean, &ldquo;What does the group of people with which
you are associated have to say about this matter?&rdquo;
Over and over again I have them ask me, &ldquo;What do
you <i>think</i> about it?&rdquo; I have heard that expression
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
many, many times during the last four weeks.</p>
<p>Well, you can see how all these different yardsticks
will get different answers. One man wants my opinion
about it, that&rsquo;s his yardstick; somebody else uses
his church&rsquo;s opinion as his yardstick; another takes
what his parents think about it; still another takes
tradition as his yardstick; and someone else takes
simply the way he feels about it. I hear them say,
&ldquo;Well, I like it, and therefore it must be all right,&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;It seems good to me.&rdquo; I recently heard a boy try
to justify his going to a particular church on the basis
that it made him feel good. Well, those are just all
irregular standards. They are not standards. People
who reason like that are using the wrong unit of
measurement.</p>
<p>Friends, God hath spoken and when God speaks
all the world should be quiet and listen. We should
take his word as final. It should be the standard by
which we decide all questions, and until the world
can agree upon the word that God has spoken as
its yardstick, as its unit of measurement, as its
standard for determining truth, we shall continue to
have division and confusion in this world. So I want
to impress you with the fact that <i>God hath spoken</i>.
Let us go to that word to find the answer to every
question that pertains to religion. In fact, I might
just say the answer to every question, for almost all
questions are answered in the Bible, at least in a general
way. If we would apply the principles of its
teachings, all of our domestic and social problems
would be solved. Our industrial and political problems
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
would be solved. Our international problems
would be solved, if all people would learn what God
hath spoken and follow it.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Will You Obey His Word?</span></h3>
<p>I hope you are impressed with the fact which
God hath spoken. Are you willing to hear that
word? Friends, the word that God has spoken tells
us that we must believe, in order to be saved.
&ldquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
son, that whosoever believeth on him should not
perish but have everlasting life&rdquo; (John 3:16). &ldquo;Without
faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to God&rdquo;
(Heb. 11:6). Faith is the very foundation of Christianity,
so much so the Bible says, &ldquo;The just shall
<i>live</i> by faith&rdquo; (Rom. 1:17). We are to walk by faith
and not by sight.</p>
<p>The word which God has spoken says that &ldquo;Except
ye repent ye shall likewise perish&rdquo; (Luke 13:3).
This word which God has spoken unto us through
his Son, Jesus, tells us that if we confess him before
men he will confess us before his Father who is in
heaven. But if we deny him, he will deny us before
his Father who is in heaven (Matt. 10:32, 33). Then,
friends, this same word which God has spoken says,
&ldquo;Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the
name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For
the promise is unto you, and to your children, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord, our
God, shall call&rdquo; (Acts 2:38, 39).</p>
<p>This word which God has spoken tells those who
have been baptized and have gone astray, to come
back repenting and confessing their faults and praying
for forgiveness (Acts 8:22; 1 John 1:9). This
word which God has spoken promises that he will
not let us be tempted above that we are able, but
will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that we may be able to bear it. (1 Cor. 10:13). This
word that God has spoken tells us to be faithful unto
death and he will give us a crown of life incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away (Rev. 2:10;
1 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>Are you willing this morning to listen to the word
which God hath spoken? I am not asking you to listen
to me or to listen to any group of people, but to
listen to the word of God. He said, &ldquo;Come unto me
all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give
you rest.&rdquo; If you are willing to hear and to heed that
word that God hath spoken, then come forward
while we sing and make your wishes known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">II</span>
<br />GENERIC AND SPECIFIC COMMANDS</h2>
<p>Our topic this morning is &ldquo;Generic and Specific
Commands.&rdquo; This subject may sound like a very
technical one; but it is, in fact, a very practical one.
A study of this topic is valuable, not merely for its
own sake, but also because it throws light on many
other questions, and is designed to help in the study
of some lessons which are to follow:</p>
<p>The Bible teaches that man must not add to, or
subtract from, the word of God. For instance, &ldquo;Ye
shall not add unto the word which I command you,
neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may
keep the commandments of the Lord your God which
I command you&rdquo; (Deut. 4:2).</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I testify unto every man that heareth the
words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall
add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
plagues that are written in this book; and if any man
shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the
book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the
things which are written in this book&rdquo; (Rev. 22:18-19).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">A Problem in Application</span></h3>
<p>These Scriptures show very plainly that <i>one must
neither add to nor subtract from the word of God</i>.
This fundamental principle is taught in both the
New Testament and the Old Testament. However,
some have difficulty in applying this teaching to
many questions arising today. Because of this difficulty
we find people who object to such things as a
baptistry in the church building, Sunday morning
Bible classes, individual cups, song books, collection
baskets, etc. These objections arise from a misunderstanding
of the basic principle announced in the
Scriptures just quoted. We hope that what is to follow
will help.</p>
<p>First of all, let it be understood that a commandment
authorizes everything essential to obeying that
commandment. For instance, the commandment to
meet and worship God authorizes a place and an
hour of meeting. The Bible does not tell us where to
meet to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper or upon what hour of
the day to meet, but the very commandment to observe
this institution authorizes some place and some
hour for the meeting.</p>
<p>This leads us to consider the difference between
a generic or <i>general</i> commandment and a <i>specific</i>
one. A generic commandment is one that authorizes
or commands a certain action, but does not give the
details as to how that commandment shall be carried
out. The difference between generic and specific
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
commandments must be recognized in applying the
Scriptures that have been mentioned. Let it be remembered
that a commandment may be mixed, partly
generic and partly specific. It may be generic with
respect to certain details which it comprehends, and
specific in reference to others.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Examples</span></h3>
<p>1. The best way I know to make these distinctions
clear is by giving a number of examples. God told
Noah to build an ark. He specified the kind of wood
that should be used. He told Noah to use gopher
wood. That authorized gopher wood and eliminated
every other possible kind of wood. Since God specified
that gopher wood should be used, it would have
been wrong for Noah to have used any other sort of
wood. It would have been a sin for him to have used
cedar wood, or oak, or any other kind which might
be named. God also told Noah to put a door in this
ark, in the side of it. But he did not tell him in <i>which</i>
side to put it. Hence, the commandment to build an
ark was generic as to the side in which the door
should be located.</p>
<p>God specified the dimensions of the ark. He told
Noah to build the ark 300 cubits long. It would have
been a sin, therefore, for Noah to have built it 301
cubits long or 299 cubits long, or any other length
except the one which God specified. God also told
Noah to build some rooms in this ark, but did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
tell him how many to build. This commandment,
therefore, was generic as far as the number of rooms
was concerned. On that point Noah was free to build
the number of rooms which he thought was best.</p>
<p>Of course, he had to build some number. The
very command to build <i>rooms</i> authorized some number
of rooms, but God did not specify the number so
Noah was free to exercise his own judgment in that
respect. God specified the animals that were to be
taken into the ark. He told Noah to take certain ones
but he did not tell him which animals to take into
the ark first. You see, therefore, that the commandment
to build the ark was specific in some respects
and was generic in other respects.</p>
<p>2. The commandment to offer a passover sacrifice
may also be used as an illustration. If God had merely
commanded the Jews to offer an animal, that
would have left them free to offer any sort of animal
which they chose. But he specified that they should
offer a lamb, which meant either a sheep or a goat.
It was also specified that it should be of the first year,
a male, and without blemish. These details were specified
with the commandment. It would have been
a sin for the Jews to have ignored any of these specifications.
In those days the word &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; was understood
to mean either a sheep or a goat. The Jews
were free to offer either, but they had to heed the
specifications that it be of the first year, without
blemish, and of the male sex.</p>
<p>3. Coming to the New Testament for an illustration,
we refer to the great commission as recorded
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
by Mark in the 16th chapter of his book, verses 15
and 16: &ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall
be damned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again we have a commandment which is
partly generic and partly specific. The word &ldquo;go&rdquo; is
generic with respect to the means of travel to be
used. The general form of this commandment leaves
one free to travel by any suitable method. In obeying
this commandment one may travel by rail, by boat,
by airplane, by automobile, on foot, on horseback, or
by any other method that is in decency and in order.</p>
<p>I recently held a meeting in Alabama which people
attended by practically every means of transportation.
They came by train, by bus, by automobile,
on tractors, in buggies, on horseback, on foot, in
wagons, in trucks&mdash;in almost every conceivable way
except by airplane or motorboat. The general commandment
to <i>go</i> leaves one free to travel in any of
these ways.</p>
<p>But this same commandment is specific in respect
to what shall be taught after one gets to the place of
teaching. It specifies that one shall preach the <i>Gospel</i>.
The message that is to be delivered is therefore
specified. It <i>must</i> be the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>
<p>4. Matthew&rsquo;s statement of this same commission
says, &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you.&rdquo; The
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
commandment to teach is specific as to the message,
but it is generic with reference to the method that
shall be used in the teaching.</p>
<p>According to the general command to teach, the
lesson may be either oral or written. The teacher
may be either a man or a woman, and the size of the
class may be whatever circumstances and expediency
justify. This commandment to teach does not specify
the number that shall be in the class, or the sex of
the teacher, or whether the lesson shall be an oral
one or a written one.</p>
<p>In this same great commission we have the commandment
to baptize in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost those who have
been taught. Since these names have been specified,
it would be a sin to baptize in the name of any
human being or any human institution.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;baptize&rdquo; itself denotes the act. It
means to be immersed, buried in water (Col. 2:12).
However, this commandment does not tell us how
the immersing shall be done. We may immerse one
according to this commandment face foremost, sideways,
lying down, standing up or in any other appropriate
way, just as long as we obey the commandment
to baptize; that is, to <i>immerse</i> or <i>bury</i> in water.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Principle Applied</span></h3>
<p>1. Some one may say that according to this principle
of interpretation instrumental music may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
justified. Let us see if this is true. If God&rsquo;s word had
merely told us to make music, that would have been
generic as far as the type of music is concerned. But
it so happens that God did not leave this commandment
in such a general form. He specified the type of
music we shall use in worshiping him.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Speaking to yourselves in
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
making melody in your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Colossians
3:16, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one
another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.&rdquo; God,
therefore, has specified the kind of music. He tells
us to <i>sing</i>.</p>
<p>If God had merely told Noah to build an ark, he
could have used any kind of wood that he chose or
any other material. He could have used either cedar
or gopher, but when God commanded him to use
gopher wood, that drew a ring around the word
gopher and eliminated every other type of building
material. If he had merely told the Jews to offer a
sacrifice at the passover, they might have offered
either a calf or a lamb; but when he commanded
them to offer a lamb, that drew a ring around the
word lamb and eliminated every other type of sacrifice
that might be conceived.</p>
<p>Likewise, with reference to the music that we offer
in our worship, if God had just said, &ldquo;Make music,&rdquo;
then we could have used any kind we chose, but he
has specified singing. This eliminates every other
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
conceivable kind of music as far as our worship to
Jehovah is concerned.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hear people say that God does not
tell us not to use instrumental music. This is a mistake.
He does tell us not to use it. He does so in
Colossians 3:16 and in Ephesians 5:19. Those Scriptures
that tell us to offer vocal music in our worship
tell us, as plain as day, <i>not</i> to offer any other kind.</p>
<p>Surely everyone will agree that it would have been
a sin for Noah to have built the ark out of cedar
wood. Everyone will likewise agree that it would
have been wrong for the Jews to have offered a cow
as a passover sacrifice. By the same line of reasoning,
and just as clearly to be seen, it would be wrong today
for people to substitute some other kind of music
for the kind that God has specified.</p>
<p>2. The commandment to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper
in memory of Jesus Christ is generic in some respects
and specific in others. The Bible specifies the day
of the week upon which this institution shall be observed.
This lesson is taught by means of divinely
approved example as recorded in Acts, chapter 20
and verse 7: &ldquo;Upon the first day of the week when
the disciples came together to break bread, Paul
preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow;
and continued his speech until midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible therefore specifies that the Lord&rsquo;s supper
shall be observed upon the first day of the week,
but this teaching is generic as far as the hour of the
day is concerned. There have been people who
argued that it would be a sin to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
at 7:30 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> There are others who believe it is
wrong to eat it at 11:00 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>, just because the Bible
does not specify that hour. But the same objection
could be raised to any other hour mentioned, and
thereby eliminate the possibility of eating it at all.
The commandment to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper upon
the first day of the week, necessarily implies that it
should be eaten at <i>some</i> hour, and God has seen fit
to leave man free to use his own judgment in selecting
the hour of the day.</p>
<p>The Bible specifies that the fruit of the vine shall
be used, but it does not say whether that fruit shall
be fermented or unfermented. The failure to recognize
this fact has led some to contend that it&rsquo;s a sin
to use grape juice. The very same type of error has
caused others to contend that it would be wrong to
use wine. We must recognize the fact that God has
left this commandment generic as to whether the
fruit of the vine shall be fermented or unfermented.</p>
<p>Likewise the Bible does not designate the number
of cups that shall be used, leaving us free to use our
own judgment upon that point as well. It is true that
the Bible refers to &ldquo;the cup,&rdquo; but every careful student
knows that that refers to the contents and not to
the vessel. As a matter of fact, there must be some
distribution made between the original container and
the lips of those who partake. The Bible does not
specify at what stage this distribution shall be made.
God has endowed us with intelligence, and expects
us to use it in applying these commandments which
are left in generic form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>3. Other examples of generic commands of a
slightly different form are these: &ldquo;Therefore, all
things ye would that men should do to you, do ye
even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets&rdquo;
(Matt. 7:12). &ldquo;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation
hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously and godly in this present world,
looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearance
of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ&rdquo; (Titus 2:11-13). &ldquo;Pure religion and undefiled
before God and the Father is this; to visit the fatherless
and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
unspotted from the world&rdquo; (Jas. 1:27). All of
these are general commandments governing Christian
conduct. They announce certain general principles
that should guide us in our behavior. We must use
our own best judgment in applying these principles
to the various questions that arise, and we should
pray for wisdom to make the proper application.
(Jas. 1:5).</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Important Conclusions</span></h3>
<p>1. There are certain important conclusions which
should be drawn from what has already been said.
First, in a sphere where God has made specifications
we must heed them. We must not ignore them. We
must not change them. What he specifies <i>must</i> be
done. In executing a command we must heed these
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
specifications. To do otherwise would be an act of
disobedience to God Almighty.</p>
<p>2. Second, where God has made no specifications
we should not make any and try to bind them on
others. To do so would be to add to the word of God,
and to violate the principle taught in Revelations
22:18-19 and at many other places in the Bible. God
had a good reason for leaving certain commandments
in a general form. For me to work out specifications
concerning how those general commandments should
be obeyed and undertake to bind my inventions on
others would be a very grievous sin.</p>
<p>In the execution of a general commandment, each
individual and each congregation is left to make its
own choices. It&rsquo;s just as much harm to make specifications
where God has made none, as it is to ignore
those specifications that he has made. It would be
just as wrong to specify that the Lord&rsquo;s supper must
be eaten at 7:30 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> as it would be to ignore the
specification that music used to worship God must
be vocal.</p>
<p>3. Third, in the execution of these general commandments,
we should use wisdom. Someone has
said that there are three kinds of sense: revealed
sense, common sense, and nonsense. Where there is
revealed sense we must follow it; but where there is
no revealed sense, where God has given a general
commandment and left us free to execute it according
to our best judgment, we should use common
sense and not nonsense. In all matters, wisdom should
be exercised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>There are many Scriptures that verify this conclusion.
For instance, &ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let
him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let
him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind
and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall
receive anything of the Lord&rdquo; (James 1:5-7).</p>
<p>Wisdom has been defined as the ability to properly
apply knowledge. In this connection it would
be ability to properly apply the knowledge that we
have received from God&rsquo;s word. Such wisdom comes
as a result of experience and age and study and
prayer. Hebrews 5:14 says, &ldquo;But strong meat belongeth
to them that are of full age, even those who by
reason of use have their senses exercised to discern
both good and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently that is the reason God has ordained
that the older or experienced men shall be the overseers
of the local congregation. Evidently that&rsquo;s also
the reason he ordained that children should obey
their parents rather than parents obey the children.
Oftentimes those who are older can discern good or
evil where the younger and less experienced are unable
to do so.</p>
<p>Even the apostles were admonished to use wisdom.
Christ said to the twelve in Matthew 10:16: &ldquo;Behold,
I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be
ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let all things be done decently and in order&rdquo; (1
Cor. 14:40).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>4. Remember then these three important conclusions.
First, in a sphere where God has made specifications
we must heed them. We must not ignore them
or change them. We must not substitute something
of our own choosing, for that which Jehovah has
specified. Specifications in a given sphere automatically
eliminate everything else that comes within the
same sphere or category. Second, where he has made
no specifications we must not make any. We certainly
must not try to bind any on others. And, third, in
applying his general commandments, we should use
wisdom. We should use common sense and not nonsense.
Recognition and proper application of these
principles will furnish a ready solution to many
otherwise difficult questions.</p>
<p>5. In reference to the plan of salvation, God has
been very explicit. He specifies that one must believe
in order to be saved (Acts 16:31). He specifies that
repentance is essential (Acts 3:19). He likewise specifies
that we should confess with our mouths the faith
that we have in our hearts (Acts 8:37). And he is
equally definite in teaching that baptism is a condition
of salvation. &ldquo;Then Peter said unto them, Repent,
and be baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). &ldquo;And
now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and
wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord&rdquo;
(Acts 22:16). You are invited and urged to heed
these specifications.</p>

<br />INTOLERANCE</h2>
<p>We are certainly happy to have so many visitors
present and want you to know that you are always
more than welcome at our service. It is our purpose
to do everything we can to show our appreciation
and make your visit with us pleasant and profitable.</p>
<p>Our topic this morning is &ldquo;Intolerance.&rdquo; It is both
timely and important. During the past week an organization
of churches throughout the nation has
been celebrating what is called Brotherhood Week
and preaching the doctrine of tolerance. There was
a panel discussion on this subject at Watkins Institute
last Tuesday night which indicated that people
are interested in this topic and also illustrated the
need for tolerance. So we feel that we are speaking
on something which is of very great current interest.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the panel was also an index to the
interest people have in a public hearing of religious
differences. A religious debate will still attract a bigger
crowd than any other sort of church service. It is
a mistake to conclude that people are not interested
in a discussion of religious issues. There was a debate
just a few days ago at White House, Tennessee, in a
very small congregation, perhaps not more than forty
or fifty members. The crowds overflowed the building.
They moved to the gymnasium of the local
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
school and filled it before the debate closed. This indicates
the extent to which people are interested in
public investigations of religious questions.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Issue Defined</span></h3>
<p>1. In order to study intelligently the subject of
intolerance we need to understand definitely the
meaning of the term. The words &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; &ldquo;intolerance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;tolerate,&rdquo; and so on, have several different
meanings. If we aren&rsquo;t careful, one person will be
thinking of one meaning of a term and another of a
different meaning. If you look these words up in your
dictionary, you will see several definitions. In order
that we may understand each other, then, I want to
cite two or three of them.</p>
<p>2. One definition says that intolerance means unwillingness
to bear or endure. In other words, it
means unwillingness to suffer long. Of course, in that
sense intolerance is wrong, because the Bible teaches
that we should be longsuffering. One of the fruits of
the Spirit is longsuffering (Gal. 5:22). &ldquo;And we exhort
you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage
the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering
toward all&rdquo; (1 Thess. 5:14 ARV). There are
many other Scriptures in the New Testament which
teach the importance, the necessity, of our being
longsuffering. So, of course, in this sense we ought to
be tolerant, we ought to be willing to endure, to suffer,
and to bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>3. According to Funk and Wagnal&rsquo;s dictionary,
the word &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo; also means &ldquo;not disposed to
tolerate contrary beliefs or opinions.&rdquo; There, you see,
intolerance is defined in terms of the word &ldquo;tolerate,&rdquo;
so we need to know what it means. The word
&ldquo;tolerate&rdquo; means &ldquo;to suffer to be, or to be done, without
active opposition.&rdquo; You put all that together and
you simply get this: tolerance means to let the beliefs
and opinions which are contrary to your own go
without opposition; whereas, intolerance according
to this definition, or meaning of the word, would
mean to oppose the beliefs and opinions which are
contrary to your own. Now, the question is, should
we be tolerant in this sense? Should we be tolerant in
the sense of allowing beliefs and opinions which are
contrary to our own go without any active opposition
on our part? I think this makes the issue clear.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Some Necessary Distinctions</span></h3>
<p>1. In order to answer this question, I am persuaded
that we will have to make a distinction between
belief and opinion, and a distinction between
things that are essential and things which are not
essential. (In making this statement I am aware that
the study of such a distinction may itself involve a
debate, but I am not opposed to debates.) In other
words, saying that a man should be tolerant is something
like saying he ought to &ldquo;be in favor of.&rdquo; Well,
in favor of what? Before you can say a man ought to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
be in favor, you have to know what is under consideration.
Am I in favor of it? That depends upon
what you are talking about. Am I tolerant of it? That
depends upon what you are talking about. There are
some things I can and should tolerate. There are
some other things that I cannot and ought not, in
the light of God&rsquo;s word, tolerate at all.</p>
<p>2. In reference to things which do not affect one&rsquo;s
salvation, we ought to be tolerant. For instance, there
are some folk who think it is wrong to eat meat, and
some other folk who think it is all right to eat meat.
You can go to heaven without eating meat and you
can go to heaven while you eat meat. It doesn&rsquo;t make
any difference as to your salvation. On a point like
that we ought to be very generous and very tolerant.</p>
<p>This question is discussed at length in the fourteenth
chapter of Romans. &ldquo;Him that is weak in the
faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another,
who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth
despise him that eateth not; and let not him
which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God
hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another
man&rsquo;s servant? To his own master he standeth
or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able
to make him stand&rdquo; (Rom. 14:1-4).</p>
<p>Let a man eat vegetables only if he so desires. Let
another man eat meat if he wants to. In such cases
the strong in faith should be considerate of those who
are weak. &ldquo;For meat destroy not the work of God.
All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
who eateth with offence&rdquo; (Rom. 14:20). &ldquo;We then
that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of
us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For
even Christ pleased not himself: but, as it is written,
The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on
me&rdquo; (Rom. 15:1-3). If I had time this morning, it
would be well to read the entire fourteenth chapter
of Romans and discuss it in connection with the
question of our attitude toward matters that are indifferent.</p>
<p>3. What should be our attitude toward matters of
belief that do effect one&rsquo;s eternal salvation? The question
really boils down to this: What should be our attitude
toward people who are in error according to
our judgment? Should we allow people whom we believe
to be in error to go without correction, without
some effort on our part to show them that they are
wrong and endeavor to get them to change? Certainly
not.</p>
<p>On the contrary the Bible clearly teaches the duty
of doing every thing in our power to help people who
are in danger. Before developing this point, however,
let us note the necessity of distinguishing between
scriptural and unscriptural methods or means of opposing
error. We cannot oppose false beliefs with
physical or political force. Jesus said, &ldquo;My kingdom
is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this
world, then would my servants fight ...&rdquo; (John 18:36).</p>
<p>Even people who are wrong, who are in error,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
who are on their way to destruction, who hold beliefs
which will damn their souls, are not to be opposed
with physical force, or with political force. Neither
are we expected to oppose them with scorn and ridicule.
We are expected to do everything we can in
love and kindness to teach them the truth and persuade
them to obey it.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Examples of Sinful Intolerance</span></h3>
<p>1. My brethren and I should be the first to preach
against the use of unfair methods in opposing those
who are thought to be in error. We have suffered
more at the hands of such intolerance than we have
ever caused others to suffer. In a certain town the
members of a denomination threatened to boycott
one of their own group if he sold a building lot to
members of the church of Christ who were establishing
a congregation there, and thus caused him to
back out on a trade he had already made. Such prejudiced
and unfair opposition was both undemocratic
and sinful. To have exercised freedom of speech in
a public discussion of religious differences would
have been honorable and democratic, but this the
denominationalists would not do. They were too
&ldquo;broadminded&rdquo; and &ldquo;tolerant.&rdquo; It is strange that in
politics people understand freedom of speech to mean
that one may publicly criticize his opponent, while
in religion they pretend that it means something entirely
different.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>2. Sometimes our young people are treated with
sinful intolerance at school because they refuse to
engage in dances. Sometimes they are treated with
intolerance when they fail to take part in the gambling
games, games of chance, which are played in
some of the schools. Very often when they refuse to
go to picture shows they are laughed at and made
fun of. It is not a question of somebody&rsquo;s attempting
with love and sincerity to persuade them to change
their convictions; too often it is simply a matter of
ridicule.</p>
<p>I could give some instances and call names of
Christian young people who have been persecuted
in public schools because they had a standard of
morality and conduct which was different from that
of the majority in the school. That is intolerance of
a sinful sort. It is the wrong sort of opposition. Endeavoring
to teach in love and kindness what one
believes, even mistakingly, to be the truth is legitimate;
but opposing contrary beliefs and ideals with
ridicule and fun-making is wrong.</p>
<p>3. We saw an example of this at the panel discussion
last Tuesday night. The chairman of the meeting
was inclined to poke fun at some in the audience
who arose to ask questions, apparently asking the
questions in all sincerity. He would encourage the
audience to give them the &ldquo;horse laugh.&rdquo; The meeting
which was called to promote tolerance manifested
intolerance of an ugly sort.</p>
<p>It was said that this meeting was being called to
advocate the doctrine that we should discriminate
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
against no one because of his color, his creed, or his
race. These three words don&rsquo;t belong together. Color,
creed, and race do not come in the same category. A
man is not responsible for his color. He had no
choice in it. A man is not responsible for the race to
which he belongs. He had no choice in it. He was
born that way. But a man does have a choice in reference
to his creed. He chooses his creed. He can believe
what he wants to believe.</p>
<p>It is not right to put color, race, and creed all in
the same class. Certainly, you should not hold a man
responsible for his color. You should not hold him
responsible for his race. He had no choice in the
matter and where there is no choice there is no responsibility.
But a man is responsible for what he
believes. This the Bible abundantly teaches. For example,
&ldquo;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they are of God: because many false
prophets are gone out into the world&rdquo; (1 John 4:1).</p>
<p>4. The irony of the situation was that some colored
men, who endeavored to attend the meeting,
which was to promote brotherhood of all the races,
all the creeds and all the colors, were turned away
from the door and not allowed to come in, because
they were the wrong color. It is right to make a distinction
between a man&rsquo;s color and his creed, but the
distinction ought to be made in favor of not holding
him accountable for his color, while holding him
accountable for his creed. It seems that the spirit of
the occasion was just the opposite. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hold
you accountable for your creed, but if you are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
wrong color you can&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo; Well, that doesn&rsquo;t
quite make sense, does it?</p>
<p>We ought not oppose error by such illegitimate
means as physical or political force, embarrassment
and ridicule, or making fun. Such weapons are very
powerful; but they are unlawful. We ought not try
to get one to be baptized by making fun or ridiculing
him. If I caused him to be baptized by physical
or political force, or by the force of ridicule and sarcasm,
it wouldn&rsquo;t do him any good. He would be
prompted by the wrong motive. One&rsquo;s obedience to
God must be of his own free will.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Intolerance in Schools</span></h3>
<p>1. While I am talking about the advantage which
is sometimes taken of people in school, I want to read
something from Harry Emerson Fosdick. He is a
man that I wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily quote or refer to. He
is a liberal. There are a thousand things on which I
disagree with him, but he has said something in a
recent article which I think is worth passing on. I
might not even agree with everything in this quotation,
but you&rsquo;ll see the point.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;I am a liberal; I am not pleading for
sectarianism or conventional orthodoxy or anything
of that sort. What I want most of all is that Roman
Catholics, Jews, and Protestants should prepare together
some book or books by means of which the
best elements in the spiritual heritage of our race
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
can be presented in our schools, objectively and
without offense, as a matter of information.&rdquo; Whether
or not that is possible might be open to debate. But
listen to what he says next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s this meanwhile that I am interested
in, &ldquo;Meanwhile, however, I am fed up with
a familiar type of course in some of our institutions,
where religion may not be taught but where,
by innuendo and clever sniping, irreligion is taught.
The Jewish prophets, Christ, and the creative seers
of our spiritual tradition might as well never have
existed, while Freud, for example, not simply as the
great pioneer in psychiatry but as an atheistic materialist,
is presented at length as though he were
infallible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. If I were to go into some of our public schools
and teach the truth on church unity and the meaning
of baptism, I would be considered intolerant, narrow
minded and out of order in using the public
schools to teach religion. But when a man gets up
and teaches that the Bible is not true, he is teaching
religion, even though it is a false religion. He is
teaching a religion just the same as the man who
says that the Bible is true.</p>
<p>That reminds me of one college professor who
asked his class at the beginning of the course how
many of them believed that God existed. Several students
raised their hands. He said, &ldquo;I predict that
by the time this course is finished there won&rsquo;t be any
here who believe in God.&rdquo; He was teaching religion&mdash;false
religion. He was opposing the truth. He was
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
taking advantage of a state school in which to do it.</p>
<p>3. When I was going to high school nearly every
chapel speaker who was not a member of the church
of Christ would tell us that one church was as good
as another. The members of the church of Christ
who came never gave us the opposite side of that.
They should have told us that one church was not
as good as another&mdash;that there is only one church.
However, if they had done so, they would have been
accused of being narrow minded and of preaching
their own peculiar doctrine. But the man who says
that one church is just as good as another is preaching
what he believes just as much as I am preaching
what I believe when I say that one is not just as
good as another. So you see this matter of tolerance
ought to work both ways in public institutions. If
one is not allowed to say that there is just one
church, then someone else who believes differently
ought not to be allowed to say that one is just as
good as another.</p>
<p>But to continue with Mr. Fosdick. &ldquo;The separation
of church and state is a fundamental principle
of American democracy, but we are allowing it to
mean what the fathers of the republic never dreamed
it should mean: that youth, in our public institutions
of learning, may be taught the denials of faiths
but not the affirmations of them. Our postwar world
cannot be reconstructed on the basis of any negative
futilitarian philosophy. We desperately need great
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
faiths about life issuing in great ethical standards for
life.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Fosdick is saying that if it is
contrary to the principles of democracy for one to
teach in public schools the tenets of his faith, it is
equally contrary for an infidel to teach his infidelity
and try to destroy the faith of his students. Both are
forms of religion. On that point I agree with Mr.
Fosdick. It is wrong for infidels to hide behind a
hypocritical plea for tolerance while they ply their
evil trade of making unbelievers of American youth.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Righteous Intolerance</span></h3>
<p>1. Now, I want to give you some Scriptures to
show that we ought to oppose, that we are <i>obligated</i>
to oppose, what we believe to be wrong. 1 Timothy
5:20 says, &ldquo;Them that sin reprove in the sight of
all, that others may also be in fear.&rdquo; That is active
opposition, isn&rsquo;t it? According to Webster, that is
intolerance, but it is the sort of intolerance which
the Bible demands. Paul said in Galatians, chapter
2 and verse 11, that he withstood Peter to the face,
because he was to be blamed. The apostle Paul opposed
the apostle Peter concerning his attitude toward
the Gentiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may
be sound in the faith&rdquo; (Titus 1:13). This doesn&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
say merely &ldquo;Rebuke them,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Rebuke them
sharply.&rdquo; That is active opposition. &ldquo;Contend earnestly
for the faith once delivered unto the saints&rdquo;
(Jude 3). Here again earnest contention is not only
permitted, but even commanded. Second Corinthians
5:11 says, &ldquo;Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,
we persuade men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. God told Ezekiel that if he failed to warn sinners,
then their blood would be required at his
hands. Hear the charge: &ldquo;Son of man, I have made
thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore
hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning
from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou
shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning,
nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked
way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die
in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not
from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he
shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered
thy soul. Again, when a righteous man doth turn
from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I
lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because
thou hast not given him warning, he shall die
in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done
shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require
at thine hand. Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous
man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth
not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned;
and thou hast delivered thy soul&rdquo; (Ezek. 3:17-21).
These texts are sufficient to show that we are bound
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
by the law of God to give active opposition to the
things which we believe to be sinful and harmful
to the spiritual welfare of men.</p>
<p>3. That gentleness and longsuffering should characterize
this work has been clearly revealed. &ldquo;Brethren,
if a man among you be overtaken in a fault,
ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the
spirit of meekness,&rdquo; [not in the spirit of braggadocio
or sarcasm; not with ridicule, abuse, or persecution;
not with physical or political force, but in the spirit
of meekness] &ldquo;considering thyself lest thou also be
tempted&rdquo; (Gal. 6:1). Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;I charge
thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ
who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing
and his kingdom, preach the word; be instant
in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort,
with all longsuffering and teaching&rdquo; (2 Tim.
4:1-2). Hence, in the light of God&rsquo;s Holy Word, it
is my duty to do everything I can, in meekness and
with persuasion, to correct those whom I believe to
be in error.</p>
<p>4. If you believe that I am saying something today
which ought not be said, it is your duty to come to
me after the service is over, or even to speak up now,
and tell me wherein I am wrong. This is the work
of a friend. If you go away and tell somebody else
that you think I made a mistake and never let me
know it, then you are playing the part of an enemy.
But if you come to me and endeavor to show me
where you believe I made a mistake then you will
be proving yourself to be a friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Standard of Authority Necessary</span></h3>
<p>Before these things which I have been advocating
can be successfully applied we must first of all have
a common standard. It was brought out in the panel
discussion last Tuesday night that the three men on
the panel each had a different standard. Assumedly,
the Protestant speaker accepted the entire Bible as
the inspired word of God. The Jew did not. He did
not accept the New Testament or the Christ of the
New Testament; he accepted only the Old Testament.
The Catholic speaker plainly stated that he accepted
neither as his authority, but that he placed
his confidence in the mind of man; of course, that
meant the mind of one particular man whom they
are pleased to call their pope. The word &ldquo;pope&rdquo;
means father. The man whom they call pope is not
married, never has been married. He is an old bachelor,
yet he is called father by more people than
anybody else on the earth. The Bible says &ldquo;call no
man your father upon the earth&rdquo; (Matt. 23:9).</p>
<p>The Catholic speaker was addressed in the panel
discussion as &ldquo;Father So and So.&rdquo; If I had been on
that discussion I would have called him Mr. Cleary.
I suppose during a meeting advocating tolerance he
would have meekly tolerated my doing so. For me
to call him father would be a violation of my conscience
and of the word of God. I couldn&rsquo;t have
called Mr. Julius Mark &ldquo;Rabbi Mark,&rdquo; because my
Bible says, &ldquo;But be not ye called Rabbi&rdquo; (Matt.
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
23:8). I know Mr. Mark doesn&rsquo;t agree with me on
that because he doesn&rsquo;t accept the New Testament
as his Bible. I know the Catholic wouldn&rsquo;t agree
with that, because he says the Bible is not the standard,
that this man whom he calls father is the
standard.</p>
<p>Just think how ridiculous it is for three men to
pretend that they are brethren when two of them
propose to believe in Christ and the other one
doesn&rsquo;t; one believes the New Testament and neither
of the others do; and one believes that the man
whom he calls pope has all the authority and neither
of the others do. They haven&rsquo;t yet agreed upon the
authority or standard to which we should make appeal
in order to settle our differences.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Impractical &ldquo;Tolerance&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>During the few remaining minutes I want to talk
about a different sort of intolerance&mdash;or rather a
different sort of so-called tolerance&mdash;the kind that is
being advocated generally by such meetings as we
had last Tuesday night, and by a great many folk
whom I meet from day to day. This particular type
of tolerance simply means that we ought to agree
with everybody on everything and oppose nobody on
anything. That is what it amounts to. Its advocates
pretend to endorse everything and everybody and
oppose nobody and nothing.</p>
<p>Let me make it clear that this is only a theory.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Even the people who advocate it do not practice it.
Nobody practices it. If you are going to take the attitude
of opposing nothing and endorsing everything
and everybody, then you have to endorse intolerance.
Such so-called tolerance would cut off all evangelism.
You couldn&rsquo;t try to convert anybody to anything if
you put that into practice. You&rsquo;d just have to agree
with everybody on everything. So you see it is mostly
a theory.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t really agree on things on which they
don&rsquo;t agree. When they pretend that they are sacrificing
their convictions in order to be together, if
you will look right close, you&rsquo;ll probably find that
they don&rsquo;t have any convictions. During this very
hour while I am standing here talking to you, Mr.
Julius Mark is preaching at the Vine Street Christian
Church as a token of this &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo; that we are
talking about wherein everybody is supposed to endorse
everybody. Think of it! Julius Mark will tell
you plainly that he does not believe the New Testament,
that he does not believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God. He denies it. And yet he is
preaching at this very minute in a congregation which
wears the name Christian. If there is anything in this
world on which Christians must be united it is the
belief that Jesus is the Christ. A fellow who doesn&rsquo;t
believe that has no right whatsoever to call himself
a Christian.</p>
<p>This almost convinces me that the Vine Street
Christian Church does not have too much faith in
Christ themselves or they wouldn&rsquo;t have a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
preaching for them who professedly disbelieves in
Him. I think I might put this to a little test. I do
not believe in the organ that the Vine Street Christian
Church uses and they know I don&rsquo;t. Suppose
you try to get me an appointment there next Sunday.
See if you can. If you can, I&rsquo;ll go. If you get me
an appointment at the Vine Street Christian Church
Sunday I&rsquo;ll go preach for them and get somebody
else to come here. They won&rsquo;t let me do it. Why?
Because I don&rsquo;t believe in their organ. They&rsquo;ll let
a man preach for them who does not believe in
Christ, but they won&rsquo;t let a man preach for them
who does not believe in their organ. Which do they
think the more of, their organ or the Christ? What
do you think?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m mistaken. Maybe they would let me
preach there. If they do, I&rsquo;ll take this all back. If
I&rsquo;m not here next Sunday, you inquire and find out
if I&rsquo;m down there, and if I am, then you&rsquo;ll know
that I was mistaken in what I have said today. Think
of this! They will let a man preach for them who
doesn&rsquo;t believe in the Christ. But will they let a man
preach for them who does not believe in their organ?
If they don&rsquo;t, what does it mean? It means they think
more of their organ than they do of the Christ.</p>
<p>And speaking of tolerance, did you ever know of a
public meeting leaving instrumental music out of
the worship because of tolerance for the members
of the church of Christ who were present? I talked
to a man one time who advocated that we ought to
have one community church by just leaving out those
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
things which we can&rsquo;t agree upon and taking the
things we can agree upon. I said, &ldquo;What are you
going to do about these people who don&rsquo;t believe
in instrumental music? Will you leave that off for
the sake of their conscience?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ll
just have to stay on the outside till they can come
in with us.&rdquo; The people who teach that sort of tolerance
and so-called broad-mindedness don&rsquo;t practice
it. In reference to something on which they have no
conviction they will appear to be very broadminded,
but if you test them out on one of their pet theories
or hobbies or something that they do believe, then
they are just as narrow minded as anyone else, or
more so.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Basis of Unity</span></h3>
<p>In the forum last Tuesday night it was said that
we ought to leave off all doctrinal differences and
just love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Let&rsquo;s
put that to the test. What does it mean to love your
neighbor? Do you love your neighbor as you do yourself
when you see him on his way to hell and don&rsquo;t
try to stop him? Suppose you are thoroughly convinced
that your neighbor is following a doctrine
that will take him to hell, and you don&rsquo;t try to stop
him, just throw your arm around him and call him
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; is that love? Why that&rsquo;s the very opposite
of love! If you see a man riding down the highway
and know that a bridge has been washed out a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
miles ahead and he is going to run off and kill himself,
will you try to stop him? You will if you love
him. If you see a man on his way to hell, you&rsquo;ll try
to stop him if you love him!</p>
<p>I agree that we ought to love our neighbor as ourselves,
but I also insist that love will move us to do
everything we can in order to correct him when we
see him following a course which will lead unto his
destruction. Love demands that we preach the truth.
Love demands that we persuade people to obey
Christ. Love brought Jesus to this earth, and if we
have the love that he had, we will do everything in
our power to get people to believe, understand and
obey the truth.</p>
<p>In mathematics we have a very simple law which
says that things equal to the same thing are equal
to each other. If two things are both equal to a third
thing, then they are equal to each other. Friends,
that gives you the basis of Christian unity. When
we all get with Christ we&rsquo;ll all be together. Isn&rsquo;t that
simple? And that is the only ground for unity. Christian
unity cannot exist on any other basis. The only
way we can have Christian unity is for all to get
with Christ, and then we&rsquo;ll all be together. The unity
problem will then be solved. There can be no unity
when one takes Christ as his creed, another follows
the Old Testament and denies Christ, and still another
follows a man over in Rome and calls him
&ldquo;Father.&rdquo; In such a group unity cannot exist.</p>
<p>Christ is revealed in the New Testament. When
we all take our stand on the Bible and get with
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Christ, we&rsquo;ll be together. Jesus said, &ldquo;He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16).
That is what we have to do to get with him. Paul
said, speaking by the Holy Spirit, &ldquo;For as many of
you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 3:27). That&rsquo;s the way you get into
Christ. When you believe and are baptized into
Christ that puts you in Christ; then you will be with
all the other folk who are in Christ and they are the
only ones with whom you want to be. You don&rsquo;t
want to be with those who are outside of Christ because
they are lost. You want to be with those who
are in Christ.</p>
<p>If you have put on Christ through obedience to
his will and continue to follow in the footsteps of
Christ as revealed in his word, then some day you
will go home and be united with Christ forever, and
united with all other Christians forever, in the world
better than this one. Surely in this large audience
there are many people present who are ready to obey
Christ. When you do, you&rsquo;ll be taking your stand on
the ground of unity, where unity must be established
if ever established. Therefore, you will not be to
blame for the division that curses the world today.
We invite you to accept the invitation of Jesus Christ
and come to him and let him save you now. Will you
come?</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">IV</span>
<br />WHENCE SO MANY DENOMINATIONS?</h2>
<p>Sometimes the question of our topic is asked for
information. At other times it is presented argumentatively,
with the implication that the mere existence
of so many denominations is evidence of their right
to exist. The implication is that churches of human
origin, operating on human authority, could never
have secured such a large following. Back of this implication
is the assumption that the majority is necessarily,
or at least usually, right.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Majority Frequently Wrong</span></h3>
<p>Those who make this assumption underestimate
the capacity of mankind for making mistakes! In the
days of Noah only eight people on the earth were
right. All the others were wrong. You who put your
confidence in the majority would have said, &ldquo;Noah,
you&rsquo;re wrong. It will never rain as you predict. There
are only eight people in your little group; all the rest
in the world, including many highly educated and
brilliant men, are against you. The majority must be
right; therefore, you are wrong.&rdquo; I imagine a great
many people reasoned after this fashion in Noah&rsquo;s
time; but those who did got drowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>In the days of Jesus the majority was wrong again.
When he died on the cross only a handful stayed
with him. Practically all the world had turned
against him. If the majority had been right, then
Jesus would have been wrong, but we know that
such was not the case.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly teaches that the majority will be
lost. &ldquo;Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the
gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,
and many there be which go in thereat; because
strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth
unto life, and few there be that find it&rdquo; (Matt. 7:13, 14).
Hence in matters pertaining to your soul it
is not safe to put your confidence in the majority.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Bible Demands Unity</span></h3>
<p>In all sincerity then, where did so many denominations
come from? Did they come from the Bible? No.
The Bible reveals only one church. Jesus Christ said,
&ldquo;Upon this rock I will build my church&rdquo; (Matt.
16:18). Note that he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; The Bible
teaches that God&rsquo;s children should be united. Just
before he died on the cross Jesus prayed that the unity
which existed between Him and the Father might
also exist among all believers. &ldquo;Neither pray I for
these alone, but for them also which shall believe on
me through their word; that they all may be one; as
thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
may be one in us: that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me&rdquo; (John 17:20, 21).</p>
<p>Recently I heard a college professor say he was glad
that we have numerous denominations. I don&rsquo;t think
he realized what he was saying. His remark amounted
to an expression of gratitude for the fact that the condition
for which our Lord prayed does not exist
among the majority of those who claim to be His
disciples.</p>
<p>Unity of thought and word is required. &ldquo;Now I
beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ that ye all speak the same thing, and that there
be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfectly
joined together in the same mind and in the same
judgment&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:10). Divisions and parties are
condemned (Gal. 5:20).</p>
<p>As you know, we have the opposite of this biblical
requirement. All who profess to follow Jesus are not
united. In the United States alone there are more
than two hundred denominations. One group teaches
one thing; another something different. One denomination
says, &ldquo;Lo, here is Christ.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;No,
He is with us.&rdquo; Consequently, people are confused
and know not which way to turn. Some are driven
into infidelity. Many decide that the whole thing is
incomprehensible and just decide to follow the line
of least resistance.</p>
<p>What is the source of all this division and consequent
confusion? Is it the Bible? Is it possible that
God failed to reveal clearly his will to man? Is it so
ambiguous that we can not all &ldquo;see it alike?&rdquo; If so,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the Bible is a failure. If the Bible is not an adequate
ground of unity, there is no such ground. If the Bible
is not a sufficient basis for unity then it is inconsistent;
for certainly its ideal is unity. So I wish to go
on record in declaring that the Bible is not the source
of the trouble!</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">A Partial Answer</span></h3>
<p>In our search for the origin of denominational divisions,
with all their attendant evils, we must look
in some other direction. Let me appeal to you as an
individual. How did you come to be what you are
religiously? Where did you get your conception of
Christianity? From reading the Bible, or from some
other source? Did you form your church connection
because of conviction resulting from prayerful, diligent,
and faithful Bible study? Or did you merely
follow the example of your parents, the social set to
which you belong, your personal taste, the law of
convenience, or some other fallible standard?</p>
<p>If you will examine your own hearts, it will throw
a lot of light, not only on where so many denominations
came from, but especially on why they are able
to continue, which is equally, if not more, important.
Even in a congregation like this, most likely there are
some whose religious course has been determined by
convenience rather than conviction. Such persons
are not steadfast. When it becomes more convenient
to do something else, or to be something else, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
will turn aside. Unless you develop some convictions,
you can easily become a liability rather than an asset.</p>
<p>In religion, as in politics, many blindly follow the
example of their parents. Even if this policy leads you
into the church we read about in the Bible, it is not
sufficient. If you are a member of the Lord&rsquo;s church,
you ought to have a better reason than the fact that
your parents happened to be members of it. You
ought to have some convictions on the subject. You
ought to be what you are because you believe you
would go to hell if you were otherwise! If that is the
way you feel, then you will be worth something to
the group to which you belong. Then you will put
the church first.</p>
<p>But how come our parents to be divided into more
than two hundred different sects? The same false
standards which cause our generation to be divided,
including the example of their parents. And so we
may trace the history of denominations and erroneous
doctrines back up the stream of time from generation
to generation, can&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>This, however, does not completely explain their
origin. They had to begin somewhere between here
and Pentecost. How far back can they be traced?
When and where did they originate?</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Early Apostasy and Roman Catholicism</span></h3>
<p>In order to answer these questions let us begin at
the other end of the line, at Pentecost, and come
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
down toward the present to see what we can find.
Since Jesus built only one church, at least one hundred
and ninety-nine of the approximately two hundred
now in existence had to get started somewhere
else, at some other time, and in some other way.</p>
<p>In the church that Jesus built, each congregation
is entirely independent of every other congregation.
The Bible teaches congregational autonomy, which
means that under Christ each congregation is entirely
independent. According to the Bible, there can be
no organization whatsoever binding two or more
congregations together. This is the first fundamental
fact to remember.</p>
<p>Second, in the church built by Christ, each local
congregation is supervised by a group of men who
are called by either of six different names: pastors,
bishops, overseers, presbyters, elders, or shepherds.
In the Bible these six names are used interchangeably.
The words elder and presbyter are both from
the same Greek word &ldquo;presbyteros&rdquo;; the words bishop
and overseer are both translations of the same Greek
word &ldquo;episkopos&rdquo;; and the words pastor and shepherd
are also synonyms, being derived from the Greek
word &ldquo;poimenas.&rdquo; Paul referred to the elders of the
church at Ephesus as bishops and designated their
work of feeding or tending the flock by using the
verb form of the Greek word for pastors or shepherds
(Acts 20:17, 28; Titus 1:5, 1:7; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2).</p>
<p>Hence, no distinction of title or rank is suggested
by the Bible use of these words. It is very important
that we remember this fact. The overseers, the pastors,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
the shepherds, the bishops, the elders, and the
presbyters are all the same men. The nine men here
whom we frequently call elders may by the same authority
be called by either of these other five names.
They are the pastors of this congregation; they are
the overseers; they are the bishops; they are the presbyters;
they are the shepherds of the flock.</p>
<p>Whenever one of these names is used to distinguish
one person from the rest of the group they describe,
trouble will always follow. That is exactly what happened
in the early history of the church. It probably
occurred in a very natural way and so gradually that
only the most vigilant became alarmed. In a group
of overseers, it is most likely that one of them will
be more active than the others. It is natural for one
of them to have more ability and more zeal as a leader
than the rest, and he is liable to become known as
the leader of the group.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass in the history of the early
church. One of the overseers, or elders, became so
much more prominent and influential than the others
that they began to designate him by a different name.
They called him the bishop. The rest of the overseers
were called presbyters. They took one of these six
Bible names and made it apply to one of the men
in the group to distinguish him from the others.
Now, that looks like a very small departure, doesn&rsquo;t
it? If I had been living in those days and had warned
the brethren against such a practice, they would have
said, &ldquo;That preacher is radical. He is making a mountain
out of a molehill. What difference does it make
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
if we want to distinguish the man who does most of
the work by calling him the bishop?&rdquo; Anyone who
opposed them would probably have been called old-fashioned,
non-progressive, etc.</p>
<p>But, friends, I want you to know that that is the
seed out of which has grown more than two hundred
denominations in America. Out of that first departure
from the Bible plan has come the ecclesiastical
hierarchies that curse the religious world today. If
you and I aren&rsquo;t very careful, we will repeat the
same error. Whenever one man in the congregation
is set above all the others in the group and is distinguished
by any title whatsoever, you are taking a
step in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Well, let us follow the matter still further. It was
also perfectly natural for this congregation which had
made one man more prominent than the others, and
distinguished him by the title Bishop, to start some
missions around over the country and exercise authority
over them until they became self-supporting.
Since the man who was now called the bishop was
head of the mother congregation, you can see how it
would be very easy for the same man to become
the head of this group of churches. Thus, less than
two hundred years after Christ, there came into
being a form of church organization quite opposite
the plan revealed in the Bible. Instead of a group of
men, with equal authority under Christ, overseeing
one congregation there was one man over a group
of congregations.</p>
<p>Doubtless there were certain congregations who
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
maintained scriptural organization, contended against
these departures, and refused to share in the digression.
When some digressed and others did not, there
was naturally a division&mdash;not because the Bible was
at fault, but because some refused to follow the Bible.</p>
<p>The territory represented by a group of congregations
over which a bishop gained control came to be
known as a diocese. Later these geographic units were
grouped to form larger units. In these larger units
one of the &ldquo;bishops,&rdquo; usually the one residing in the
capital of the province, gained ascendancy in rank
and authority over his fellow &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; and was
called the metropolitan.</p>
<p>The digression was augmented by conferences held
in the various provinces and in which the local metropolitan
served as chairman. At first, they were innocent
&ldquo;get-togethers&rdquo; of delegates from the different
congregations for the sake of fellowship, friendly
discussion of their common problems, and reaching
conclusions on disputed questions. But they soon
partook of the nature of legislative bodies, and were
called Councils by the Latins, and Synods by the
Greeks. Thus there came into existence a source of
legislation in addition to, and different from, the
Bible. The congregations joining in this movement
were deprived of their scriptural autonomy.</p>
<p>Until after <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 300 each province held its own separate
conference, and each metropolitan was entirely
independent of all the other metropolitans in the
government of his province. You can imagine how
the congregations that refused to &ldquo;string along&rdquo; with
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the crowd were condemned and boycotted by the ecclesiastical
leaders.</p>
<p>In <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 325 the first general council was called, and
the congregations represented were divided into five
groups according to the political divisions of the Roman
Empire. The ecclesiastical ruler of each group
was called &ldquo;Patriarch&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chief Father.&rdquo; This council
formulated what is known as the Nicene Creed,
which was adopted by most of the churches and which
is still acknowledged by many denominations today,
including the Roman Catholic. Naturally there was
rivalry among the five &ldquo;Chief Fathers.&rdquo; The &ldquo;bishops&rdquo;
of Rome and Constantinople managed to gain
supremacy over the other three (those at Jerusalem,
Alexander, and Antioch). The warfare between these
two was long and fierce. In <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 588 John the Faster,
the Patriarch of Constantinople, assumed the title of
&ldquo;Universal Bishop of the Church.&rdquo; The Patriarch of
Rome protested bitterly, but in <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 606 the title of
&ldquo;Universal Bishop&rdquo; was transferred from John the
Faster to the &ldquo;Roman See.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus with more than five hundred years of gradual
drifting away from the Bible plan they developed
a complete ecclesiastical hierarchy, with its councils,
creeds, and dignitaries, supposedly having authority
in addition to, different from, and in some cases,
greater than, the Bible. Authority was now divided
between the Bible and men who were presumptuous
enough to set themselves up as legislators in the kingdom
of God, which eventually culminated in the
&ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s&rdquo; ridiculous claim to be infallible. By the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
congregations sharing in this apostasy the Bible was
no longer considered a complete and final authority.</p>
<p>Sometimes today people undertake to explain the
existence of denominations by saying that we cannot
see the Bible alike. Friends, that is an insult to
God. Anybody who says that ambiguity and indefiniteness
on the part of the Bible is to blame for all
the division which God so plainly condemns is insulting
God Almighty; accusing Him of being unable
to write a book that would express what he wanted
folk to know. It is to accuse God of passing a law
against division, and condemning division, and coming
right along and giving the world a book that
would naturally result in division. I do not believe
that God is characterized by any such inconsistency.
I do not believe He would condemn us for being
divided, and then give us a book that would inevitably
divide us.</p>
<p>Friends, it is not because we are not able to see
the Bible alike, but it is because so many people
consider something else besides the Bible as authority.
I have given you a brief outline of how it started.
Any Roman Catholic &ldquo;priest&rdquo; in this town will tell
you that, in his estimation, the Bible is not the final
authority in what people are to do in religion, but
that the man whom they call the Pope is the infallible
guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Reformation and Protestantism</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that explains,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;just one denomination,
but where did all the others come from?&rdquo;
We shall try to show you the connection between the
Roman Catholic Church and many of the other denominations.
For a period of seven hundred years,
the Roman Catholics held sway over a vast majority
of people who called themselves Christians. I believe
that all down through the ages there were some folk
who rebelled against the Roman &ldquo;Pope&rdquo;; and I am of
the opinion, although I could not prove it, that in
every generation there were some faithful Christians
not always numerous and prominent enough to win
recognition in history, but who were nevertheless
contending for and obeying the truth. Be that as it
may, we know that the Roman Catholic Church dominated
most of the religious world for many centuries&mdash;until
finally the Roman Catholics and the
Greek Catholics divided in the twelfth century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>
Then those two held the reins until there came the
period in history which is known as the Great Reformation.</p>
<p>I have great respect for such men as Martin Luther,
Ulrich Zwingli, John Locke, John Calvin, and John
Wesley. [I don&rsquo;t know why so many of them were
named John, I have often wondered.] Even though
a great deal of harm has been done in the name of
these men, we must recognize them as having done
some noble work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Take Martin Luther, for instance, who found a
Bible while he was a student in a convent, and studied
it diligently. He became convinced that the sale
of indulgences was sinful and endeavored to reform
the Roman Catholic Church on this point. As a consequence
of this effort he was excommunicated. Naturally,
he started an independent movement. His
purpose was to get back to the Bible and throw off
all human authority, taking the Bible as his only
guide. If he and all of his followers had been true
to this noble ideal, there would be no Lutheran
Church on the earth today. They would have become
Christians and Christians only.</p>
<p>I am convinced that Martin Luther did not intend
to start a denomination. He pleaded with the people
not to wear his name, but rather to call themselves
Christians. He had strong convictions, and was willing
to suffer for the sake of them. But, friends, Martin
Luther had become well saturated with error
before he began to study the Bible for himself. He
could hardly have been expected to discover all the
truth immediately.</p>
<p>He knew that the Roman Catholics were wrong
on indulgences, but they were also wrong on a great
many other points which he did not discover. If he
and his followers had continued to study the Bible
and to make reformations as the need for them was
discovered, then they would have kept getting back
closer and closer to the original plan. This they did
not do. Instead they made the tragic error of formulating
a creed or confession of faith. This they probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
did with good intentions, hoping thereby to
protect their followers against the snares of Roman
Catholicism and other errors, but they defeated their
purpose. It was not long until the creed began to
be recognized as authoritative&mdash;if not as equal to the
Bible at least as a subordinate authority. Naturally
the creed was erroneous and ambiguous. It was written
by uninspired men and by men blinded and
prejudiced by Roman Catholicism. The creed makers
were wearing the colored glasses of Roman Catholicism.
They who had had Romanism drilled into them
from infancy could not instantly and entirely disabuse
themselves of it. In some cases they retained
Roman error; in other cases they were driven into
opposite extremes.</p>
<p>Naturally, after a generation or so, they acquired
members who were in the movement not because of
conviction, but because of convenience, or because
their parents were. This condition, with the deadening
effect of a creed&mdash;of a human creed&mdash;made progress
back to the Bible very difficult, if not impossible.
Each step of reformation called for a revision of the
creed, and creeds are hard to revise. People become
attached to them; they come to think more of them
than they think of the Bible itself, if they aren&rsquo;t
very careful. They develop a patriotic attitude toward
the creed which is very difficult to overcome.
Consequently, we have the Lutheran Church with
us today.</p>
<p>This appraisal of Luther&rsquo;s work will fit, in a general
way, the work of other reformers. They made
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
similar errors. If they had maintained the scientific
attitude&mdash;which means to test every point, investigate
to see if you are right and change when you&rsquo;re wrong,
prove all things and hold fast to that which is good&mdash;then
they would have kept getting back closer to
God. But when their movements became crystallized,
when they became satisfied with their <i>status quo</i>,
and had acquired a number of members who were
without conviction, then they not only ceased getting
back closer to God but they began to drift away from
Him. As a consequence, many of the denominations
today resemble their mother, the Roman Catholic
Church, more than they did in the beginning.</p>
<p>And so, my friends, we have before us a brief outline
of how denominations got started. The Roman
Catholic Church is the result of centuries of drifting
away from the New Testament pattern. Since it
reached the zenith of its power, many other denominations
have resulted from unsuccessful and incomplete
efforts to reform the Catholics or some other
existing group. In most cases the movement of the
reformers, because of indifference and a lack of conviction
in their ranks, eventually lost ground. In
every instance, consciously or unconsciously, something
besides the Bible has been accepted as authority.
Errors, which the Protestant churches, willingly
or unwillingly, inherited from the Catholics have
been handed down from generation to generation
even to the present. Thus, many unscriptural practices
and doctrines of the denominations are traceable
to the church at Rome with its preposterous
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
claim of infallibility. Many members of denominations
do not realize that much of what they get from
their parents and preachers and which they fancy to
be of Biblical origin, has, in fact, descended from
Rome and can claim no higher authority.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Restoration Movement</span></h3>
<p>But to pursue our historical survey a little further,
at the beginning of the nineteenth century with three
hundred years of Protestant denominational history
before them, various religious leaders were awakened
to the evils of creeds, and a &ldquo;back to the Bible&rdquo; movement
was begun. In America the work of these men
became known as the Restoration Movement. It was
their purpose to go back to Pentecost, to begin at
Jerusalem, as a surveyor begins at the established
corner, mark out the lines revealed in the New Testament,
and establish congregations just like the pattern
that Jesus gave. That was a noble undertaking
and it proved to be a very successful one. It was the
fastest growing religious movement the world had
seen since the days of the apostles.</p>
<p>But remember it is very difficult for reforms to stay
reformed. In a generation or so there grew up in this
movement also an element who were parties to it
because their parents were and not because of personal
conviction. Such an element is a liability to
any movement. This element has become crystallized
in the digressive wing of the movement, who, although
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
some of their followers may not realize it, no
longer regard the Bible as complete and final authority.
They have no written creed but they have discredited
the Bible. Whether they admit it or not,
their principle is: &ldquo;Where the Bible speaks we may
be silent; where the Bible is silent we are at liberty
to speak.&rdquo; Without any effort to explain how it is
done, they claim that God is still revealing his will
to man in some way independent of the Bible. They
claim to have advanced beyond the wisdom of the
apostles themselves, and regard their own intellectuality
as equal to, or superior to, the Bible. Thus,
each man becomes a law unto himself, and there is,
therefore, no ground for unity.</p>
<p>I am thankful, however, that there were some who
refused to assume an indifferent attitude, who are
still contending for the faith once delivered to the
saints, and who realize that we must be ever striving
to get closer to the divine plan revealed in the New
Testament. Since reformations will not stay reformed,
the only way to keep on the right road is to
be forever getting back on the right way. This we
cannot do unless we have conviction, and unless we
study God&rsquo;s word. That&rsquo;s one of our reasons for
giving so much emphasis to the importance of your
searching the Scriptures daily. It may be that we have
some in our very midst who do not know the difference
between the true church and a denomination,
and who cannot give an intelligent reason for the
hope that is within them. Such an element in a congregation
is easily deceived by digressive influences
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
and must become strong in the faith for their own
sake and for the safety of the church.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Need of Constant Vigilance</span></h3>
<p>Hence, my brethren, we need to be watching today,
lest we become slack and allow error to creep
into our midst and become established among us.
Remember that human nature is just the same now
that it has always been. The same sort of indifferent
attitude and drifting which resulted in the Roman
Catholic Church and which resulted in the establishment
of other denominations in the world, will make
a denomination out of us if we are not always on
the guard. Eternal vigilance is the price of being
right. We have the same human nature that others
have. If we aren&rsquo;t willing to pay the price of being
better students of God&rsquo;s word, then we, too, will drift
into another denomination, and not be worth the
time and place which we occupy. We don&rsquo;t need any
more denominations! We have enough! If you want
to be a member of a denomination you don&rsquo;t need
to start another one. You have more than two hundred
to choose from. Some of them are very highly
organized and well financed. There is no reason for
starting another one; <i>there are many reasons for not
doing so</i>! Unless we are going to understand the difference
between the true church and denominationalism,
unless we are going to contend earnestly for
non-denominational Christianity, then we do not deserve
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
to exist and the world would be better off if
we did not.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Extra-Biblical Standards</span></h3>
<p>There is one fact which I want to emphasize further.
In every case of denominationalism some authority
other than the Bible has been recognized.
Otherwise denominations could not come into existence,
and denominations could not continue to exist.
The extra-Biblical authority might be the man whom
they call the Pope at Rome. It might be your preacher
in some denomination which you look up to as
being the final authority. It might be the creed of the
denomination to which you belong. It might be the
people among whom you move. It might be your
own feelings in the matter. It might be tradition or
family heritage. But I don&rsquo;t care what it is, if it is
outside the Bible, it is not a true source of authority
in religion. The existence of so many denominations
today is not caused by people&rsquo;s being unable to see
the Bible alike. They are here because, while a few
people take the Bible as their only guide, a great
many take something else as their standard.</p>
<p>You meet a great many people who claim to take
the Bible as their only rule of faith and practice, but
when you press them to cite the scriptural authority
for certain of their practices they are utterly unable
to do so. If one takes the Bible as sole authority in
religion, then he ought to be able to point to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Scripture which gives the authority for everything
he does. So don&rsquo;t let a man get by with a mere statement
&ldquo;We take the Bible as our guide.&rdquo; If you talk
to him a few minutes, you will possibly find that he
is following some preacher, following his feelings, or
following the church to which he belongs. You may
hear him use such expressions as, &ldquo;What does your
church believe on this point?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What does the
church of Christ teach on a certain matter?&rdquo; Well, I
don&rsquo;t have any church. And the church of Christ
doesn&rsquo;t teach anything on a certain point. If it did,
its teaching would not necessarily be of any value.
Such questions, such expressions betray a wrong conception
of the church. The question should be:
&ldquo;What does the Bible teach in reference to a certain
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find authority in the Bible for your
position, you&rsquo;d better not depend upon it. Most of
the people who are at worship this very hour belong
to a church whose name they cannot find in the
Bible. Yet the preachers who preach in those
churches will tell you, &ldquo;Yes, we take the Bible as our
only guide.&rdquo; To refute their claim you need only ask
them one question: &ldquo;Where did you get your name?&rdquo;
They would probably say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nickname. Someone
else gave it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how come you to acknowledge it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we just got tired of objecting to it so we
finally acknowledged it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get it out of the Bible then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friends, think about how ridiculous it is for a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
to say, &ldquo;We follow the Bible, and the Bible only,&rdquo;
when the very name of the church to which he belongs
cannot be found from Genesis to Revelation.
The sad part of it is that a great many of the members
don&rsquo;t know the difference. I have asked people
who wore an extra-Biblical name if they could find
their name in the Bible. Frequently, they say, &ldquo;Yes.
I don&rsquo;t know where it is but I&rsquo;m sure it is in there
somewhere.&rdquo; It just isn&rsquo;t there. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t
there, but the poor folk thought it was because they
had heard some preacher say they were following
the Bible.</p>
<p>Again I protest the statement that denominations
are caused by people&rsquo;s being unable to see the Bible
alike. That is an insult to my God and I object to it.
It is because many are following something besides
the Bible. They may deny it but they are. Otherwise
there could be only one church on this earth because
there is only one church in the Bible.</p>
<p>If you belong to something this morning that you
cannot read about in the Bible, won&rsquo;t you come out
of it? Won&rsquo;t you say, &ldquo;From this morning on, I will
take the Bible as my guide. I will take one step at a
time as that step is revealed in God&rsquo;s word until it
leads me home to heaven at last&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Now, if you will do that, the way is simple. &ldquo;God
so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish
but have everlasting life&rdquo; (John 3:16). &ldquo;But without
faith it is impossible to please him&rdquo; (Heb. 11:6).
So if you are going to follow the Bible, the first thing
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
you must do is believe. Again Jesus said, &ldquo;Except ye
repent, ye shall all likewise perish&rdquo; (Luke 13:3). So
the next thing you will do is repent.</p>
<p>I heard a man say this week that the only thing
you had to do in order to be saved was just believe,
but the Bible says, &ldquo;Except ye repent ye shall all likewise
perish,&rdquo; and repentance is not believing. Repentance
is at least one thing you must do after you
believe or else the Bible says you will perish and
have no chance to be saved.</p>
<p>And then on the day of Pentecost Peter said, &ldquo;Repent
and be baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins&rdquo; (Acts 2:38).
It is not hard to see that. People who refuse to do it
simply don&rsquo;t want to see it or just don&rsquo;t want to do it
after they see it&mdash;one or the other! If you want to follow
the Bible, the way is plain, isn&rsquo;t it? If you take
something else for your guide, then no telling where
you will land.</p>
<p>But someone may say, &ldquo;What is baptism?&rdquo; Let the
Bible answer. &ldquo;Buried with him in baptism, wherein
ye are also risen with him through the faith of the
operation of God, who hath raised him from the
dead&rdquo; (Col. 2:12). &ldquo;Therefore we are buried with
him by baptism into death that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life&rdquo;
(Rom. 6:4). Hence, according to the Bible, baptism
is a burial and a resurrection. If you weren&rsquo;t buried
when you were baptized, then you were not baptized;
because the Bible says we are buried by baptism.
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
A so-called baptism which doesn&rsquo;t involve a
burial isn&rsquo;t the kind of baptism the Bible talks about.
If you do something else, you don&rsquo;t get it from the
Bible. If you stick to the Bible, you have the matter
settled. You can&rsquo;t get anything else from it except a
burial. It doesn&rsquo;t say anything else.</p>
<p>Incidentally, do you know where the doctrine of
sprinkling and pouring came from? It came from the
man who is called the Pope of Rome! At the Council
of Vienna, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1311, by no higher authority than the
Roman Catholic Church, it was decided that sprinkling
and pouring might be practiced for baptism.
Most often today the people who accept sprinkling
or pouring instead of baptism do not realize that they
are following the man over in Rome who claims to
be greater than the Bible. You probably got it from
your parents, your parents from theirs and their
parents from some preacher and so on, but the chain
leads back eventually to the Roman Catholic Church.
It has no higher authority. The Bible condemns it.</p>
<p>I beseech you in the name of Jesus Christ that you
submit unto His will as revealed unto us in the Holy
Bible. If you will follow Him, He will take you
home to rest at last.</p>

<p>By actual count there are 217 people present for
this Sunday evening worship. We are glad you are
here. Your presence is a distinct encouragement. It
helps. We can have better work by your being here
than we could if you were not here. We have some
visitors and you are very welcome. May you enjoy
with us all the blessings that are to be had here and
help us make these services even better!</p>
<p>At the close of the lesson we shall sing &ldquo;Come to
Jesus,&rdquo; for the purpose of encouraging you to accept
the Lord&rsquo;s invitation. The invitation comes from
Jesus Christ. By his authority and by the power of
the Holy Spirit the doors of the church were opened
nearly 2,000 years ago on the day of Pentecost, and
the doors of the <i>Lord&rsquo;s</i> church have been standing
wide open ever since. Whosoever will may come. We
sing this invitation song for the sake of the exhortation
it contains and to give you a convenient opportunity
to come forward and make known your desire
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
to obey the Lord. Backsliders are invited to return
to God, confessing their sins, repenting of them, and
praying for forgiveness. Those who have never been
born again are taught by the Bible to believe in
Christ, repent of their sins, confess their faith, and be
baptized for the remission of sins. We are prepared
to assist you in carrying out your obedience of these
commands. If you will come forward and make your
wishes known, we shall be glad to help you in every
way we can.</p>
<p>I promised to speak to you tonight upon the topic
&ldquo;Which Church Is Right?&rdquo; That is a very important
question, and the timeliness of it is evident by the
fact that in the United States there are more than 200
churches. Just for the sake of a round number, we&rsquo;ll
speak of them as 200. That is, indeed, enough. In
fact, too many! For, in the Bible, there is only one.
Now, you just think about that&mdash;200 in the United
States alone, to say nothing about other parts of the
world, and only one in the Bible!</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">One Church in Bible</span></h3>
<p>On the board tonight I have an outline of the lesson
and the Scriptures which shall be used. I would
like for you who are interested to write these Scriptures
down, that you may give them further study.
Search the Scriptures, as the noble people of Berea
did, to see whether these things are true. There are
many Scriptures which show that there is only one
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
church in the Bible. Here are a few of them listed
under No. 1. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus said, referring
to the confession that Peter had just made, &ldquo;Upon
this rock I will build my church.&rdquo; He used the singular
form of the word. He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;my churches,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;my church.&rdquo; Therefore, Jesus Christ built only
one. He bought and paid for only one with his
blood, and he has only one tonight. &ldquo;There is one
body&rdquo; (Eph. 4:4). There is &ldquo;but one body&rdquo; (1 Cor.
12:20). That body is the church. &ldquo;And hath put all
things under his feet, and gave him to be the head
over all things to the church, which is his body, the
fulness of him that filleth all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23).
Since there is but one body, and that body is the
church, then it naturally follows that there is but
one church. Only one church in the Bible, and more
than 200 in America! Therefore, we must face the
question, &ldquo;Which Church Is Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please remember that this is no more my problem
than it is yours. I&rsquo;m not to blame for all these
churches&rsquo; being in the world! I did not start them.
None of you started them. We found them here when
we were born into this world. They are here. We are
not responsible for their beginning. Some of you
may be responsible for helping to keep them going,
but we found them here, and we have found that
in the Bible there is only one. To decide which one
is right is as much your problem as it is mine.</p>
<p>You may think that tonight I shall undertake to
prove that the group of people with whom I am associated
is the right group and that all the others are
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
wrong. Well, I&rsquo;m frank to say that I believe I&rsquo;m right.
If I didn&rsquo;t, I would change! Some people think they
are criticizing me when they say: &ldquo;Oh, well, you just
think you&rsquo;re right and everybody else is wrong.&rdquo; I
believe that&rsquo;s a compliment. Of course I believe I&rsquo;m
right! If I didn&rsquo;t, I would change. A man who continues
in a way which he does not believe to be right
is a hypocrite! For one to teach what he sincerely
believes is not conceit but sincerity. It&rsquo;s not egotism
but honesty. Not only do I believe that what I teach
is right, but I stand ready to change it whenever
anyone can show me wherein it is wrong. But I promise
not to make a prejudiced or biased approach to
this question.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Church That Follows the Bible Is Right</span></h3>
<p>Suppose you were to undertake to examine all the
creeds of Christendom, and eliminate them one by
one to see which church is right. That would take a
very long time. You might even die with old age
before you had finished the task. I believe there is a
much shorter and more practical approach to the
solution of the question. Just go directly to the Bible
and see what it says and follow its teaching; then you
will naturally be right.</p>
<p>If I were going to answer my question tonight in
just one brief statement, I would say that the church
which follows the Bible is the one that&rsquo;s right. At
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
first thought this may sound like a very trite statement.
Somebody would reply by saying, &ldquo;Well, all
the churches claim to follow the Bible.&rdquo; Such a claim
demands investigation! It&rsquo;s easy to make such a
claim, but you notice that I did not say that the
church which <i>claims</i> to follow the Bible is right, but
that the one which <i>follows</i> the Bible is right.</p>
<p>There may be a big difference between claiming
to follow the Bible and actually following it. If you
will talk to some of these people who claim to follow
the Bible, you will hear them using expressions like
these: &ldquo;Well, I think so and so&rdquo;; &ldquo;I feel like that&rsquo;s
all right&rdquo;; &ldquo;My church teaches this and that&rdquo;; &ldquo;I
heard my preacher say so and so&rdquo;; and &ldquo;My mother
and father or grandparents always belonged to this
church.&rdquo; To such standards as these many people
are clinging. Friends, such expressions betray the
fact that the man who uses them is not taking the
Bible as his one and only guide! They betray the fact
that he is following something else besides the Bible.
Before we accept at face value a man&rsquo;s claim along
that line, we&rsquo;d better look behind it. We&rsquo;d better
listen to the man talk for a few minutes and see
whether he does actually take the Bible to be complete
and final authority in matters religious.</p>
<p>The following Scriptures show that the Bible
should be our guide: &ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God and is profitable for doctrine, for
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;
that the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good work&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:16, 17).
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
&ldquo;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach
any other gospel unto you, than that which we have
preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said
before, so say I now again, If any man preach any
other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let
him be accursed&rdquo; (Gal. 1:8, 9).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the
doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in
the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and
the Son&rdquo; (2 John 9). Then that well-known Scripture
in the last chapter of the Bible, &ldquo;For I testify unto
every man that heareth the words of the prophecy
of this book, if any man shall add unto these things,
God shall add unto him the plagues that are written
in this book: and if any man shall take away from
the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall
take away his part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city, and from the things which are written
in this book&rdquo; (Rev. 22:18, 19).</p>
<p>Many other Scriptures could be used, but these are
enough to show us that <i>the Bible should be our
guide</i>. It is sufficient and furnishes the man of God
completely unto every good work. Those who claim
to be following the Bible and the Bible only should
be expected to defend that claim, in the light of the
Bible. Frequently, I announce publicly that I stand
ready to put my finger upon the Scripture that furnishes
the authority for everything we do and teach
and believe in matters of religion. I always stand
ready to make this claim good. Everybody is invited
to check me on this basis. If you can find something
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
for which I cannot give scriptural proof, then I will
cease to teach, practice, or believe it. A preacher,
who is not willing to make such a statement, evidently
knows that he is not taking the Bible as his
one and only guide, and yet I believe you will agree
that most of the preachers in this city will not make
you this proposition.</p>
<p>Not very long ago I heard a man boldly declare
that his preacher preached the Bible and nothing
else. I began to name several things which the Bible
teaches and asked him one by one if his preacher
taught those things. In every instance he had to
answer in the negative. He had not fully realized
what was comprehended in his statement. Another
lady came to me and said, &ldquo;I just believe that all of
us ought to go back to the Bible and take it as our
guide.&rdquo; I reminded her that in that case she would
have to give up the unscriptural name which she
had been wearing and make a number of other
changes. She said, &ldquo;Well, now, let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t get back
too far.&rdquo; The truth was that she didn&rsquo;t really want
to take the Bible as her only guide! I mention all
these facts to show that you mustn&rsquo;t be too quick to
accept the claim mentioned a moment ago. You&rsquo;d
better examine it. For, as a matter of fact, if we were
all following the Bible there would be but one
church on the earth, because there is but one in the
Bible. There&rsquo;s just no escaping this conclusion.</p>
<p>So, I believe that my statement is apt. It is appropriate
to say that the church which follows the Bible
is the one that&rsquo;s right. Therefore, if you want a scriptural
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
answer to our question tonight, you don&rsquo;t need
to examine all the different creeds separately; just
take the Bible and examine it. Follow its teaching
and directions step by step. This course will lead you
into the right church, and into heaven at last. You
won&rsquo;t need to investigate all the religious organizations
which exist about us without Scriptural authority.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Conditions of Membership</span></h3>
<p>Let us see what the Bible actually teaches concerning
the doctrine and practice of the church. Then
we shall know which is right so far as these items are
concerned. I want to say now, and repeat many times
as we go along, that a church may be right on one
point and wrong on another. A church may follow
the Bible on one point and not follow it on another,
and a church is right to the extent that it follows
the Bible. It&rsquo;s wrong to the extent that it fails to do
so. No church is <i>all</i> right until it follows the Bible
on <i>all</i> points.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s look at the conditions of membership
in the church we read about in the Bible. Acts
2:47 shows that the conditions of membership in
God&rsquo;s church are identical with the conditions of
salvation. &ldquo;The Lord added to the church daily such
as should be saved.&rdquo; Since the Lord adds to His
church all saved people, the conditions of membership
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
and the conditions of salvation are exactly the
same.</p>
<p>We learn from the Scriptures listed here (speaker
points to the board) that the first thing one must do
in order to be saved is to believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of the living God. The Philippian
jailor said to Paul and Silas, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do
to be saved?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord and
to all that were in his house. And he took them the
same hour of the night and washed their stripes; and
was baptized, he and all of his, straightway&rdquo; (Acts
16:20-33). In answer to the jailor&rsquo;s question then, the
inspired preacher said first of all, &ldquo;Believe&rdquo;; then he
taught him the word of the Lord, which led to his
repentance, evidenced by the fact that, whereas he
had a few minutes ago placed stripes across their
backs with a heavy whip, he now washed those stripes.</p>
<p>Then Paul taught him and his household to be
baptized, and taught them that baptism was urgent,
because they were baptized the same hour of the
night. They did not put it off a month or a week or
even until daylight, but were baptized immediately,
or straightway, even the very same hour of the night.</p>
<p>Faith is emphasized also by Acts 2:36 where Peter
concluded his great Pentecost sermon by saying,
&ldquo;Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly
that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have
crucified, both Lord and Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;For whosoever
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
How then shall they call on him in whom they have
not believed?&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13-14). &ldquo;Without faith it&rsquo;s
impossible to be well pleasing unto God&rdquo; (Heb.
11:6). Therefore, the first condition of salvation is
faith.</p>
<p>The second one is repentance. Acts 2:38 says, &ldquo;Repent&rdquo;;
Acts 3:19 says, &ldquo;Repent&rdquo;; and Acts 17:30 says
&ldquo;Repent.&rdquo; You can go home and read these Scriptures
and you&rsquo;ll find the commandment to repent in
each of them, and it&rsquo;s given as a condition of salvation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are taught that &ldquo;with the heart
man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation&rdquo; (Rom.
10:10). And in the eighth chapter of Acts we read
that when the Ethiopian eunuch said, &ldquo;See, here is
water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? and
Philip said, If thou believest with all of thine heart,
thou mayest, and he answered and said, I believe that
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo; Therefore, confession
is a condition of salvation.</p>
<p>When the Pentecostians inquired what they must
do to be saved, the inspired apostle Peter said, &ldquo;Repent
and be baptized, everyone of you, in the name
of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins&rdquo; (Acts 2:38).
Ananias told Paul, &ldquo;And now why tarriest thou?
Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling
on the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). &ldquo;The like
figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience toward God) by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
resurrection of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:21). No one,
who knows the Bible, can have a good conscience
toward the Lord until he has been baptized. Baptism
is the answer to the quest for a good conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
but he that believeth not shall be damned&rdquo; (Mark
16:16). Friends, there are a thousand ways to go to
hell; one of them is to disbelieve. But suppose I ask
you who will be saved. You cannot give me a Bible
answer to save your life without mentioning baptism.
For Mark 16:16, the word of Jesus Christ, says, &ldquo;He
that believeth <i>and is baptized</i> shall be saved.&rdquo; To
leave out baptism would be to omit part of the
Lord&rsquo;s answer. No sane person ought to take the responsibility
of taking away part of God&rsquo;s word. You
cannot give a Bible answer to the question without
mentioning baptism!</p>
<p>According to the Bible, therefore, faith, repentance,
confession, and baptism are the conditions of
salvation. Since all saved people are added to the
Lord&rsquo;s church by the Lord, then these are also the
conditions of membership in God&rsquo;s church. The
church, which teaches this, is right on this point. It
might be wrong somewhere else, but the church
which teaches these facts is the right church as far
as the conditions of membership are concerned. Any
church which leaves off any one of them or adds
something to them just lacks that much, at least,
being right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Worship</span></h3>
<p>Let us look next at the acts of worship. There&rsquo;s
no place in the Bible which says in so many words,
&ldquo;Here are the acts ye shall perform as worship to
Jehovah&rdquo;; but there <i>are</i> certain acts commanded,
which are, by their very nature, acts of worship.
Therefore, God does state for us the acts which the
members of His church shall perform in worship
unto Him.</p>
<p>First, they should <i>pray</i>. Acts 2:42 states that the
church at Jerusalem continued steadfastly in the
apostle&rsquo;s doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking
of bread, and in prayer. Acts 20:36 gives us an example
of public prayer. At the seaside the apostle
Paul knelt down with those who were gathered with
him and prayed unto God. Prayer by its very nature
is an act of worship.</p>
<p>We also learn in First Corinthians 16:1 and 2,
that we should <i>lay by in store</i> upon the first day of
the week as we have been prospered; and that itself
is an item of worship. Giving or sacrificing unto God
for the sake of God is an act of worship.</p>
<p>From Acts 2:42, Acts 20:7, and many other Scriptures
that could be listed, we learn that <i>teaching and
studying the Bible</i> are also commanded of God&rsquo;s
children; and that, likewise, is worship.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:19 we read these words, &ldquo;Speaking
unto yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody in your heart to
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
the Lord.&rdquo; And in Colossians 3:16, &ldquo;Let the word of
Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom; teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts
to the Lord.&rdquo; These Scriptures command us to <i>sing</i>
praises to God and admonitions unto each other,
which is naturally an act of worship.</p>
<p>And then, finally, we are taught to eat the Lord&rsquo;s
supper (1 Cor. 11:17-34; Luke 22:19-20). Acts 20:7
tells us that this shall be done on the first day of the
week. The church at Troas, under apostolic guidance,
met upon <i>the first day of the week</i> to eat the
Lord&rsquo;s supper. And, friends, &ldquo;the sabbath day,&rdquo; as
the expression was used in the Old Testament, meant
every sabbath day, and by the same line of reasoning,
&ldquo;the first day of the week&rdquo; means the first day
of every week.</p>
<p>Tomorrow students will be registering out at Peabody
and Vanderbilt. Their schedules will state that
a certain class meets on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. They will not state that it meets <i>every</i> Monday
and <i>every</i> Wednesday and <i>every</i> Friday, but even
a college freshman will understand what is meant!
When we are told that a class meets on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, we know that it meets on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of every week.</p>
<p>If you were to search the New Testament to find
out how often we should eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper, you
would not find the slightest suggestion that it should
be eaten once a year. You would find no sort of hint
that it should be taken upon the first of every quarter
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
or upon one Sunday out of each month. The
only Scripture which throws any light whatsoever
upon the question puts it upon a weekly basis.</p>
<p>John 4:24 shows that all these acts of worship
must be done in spirit and in truth. &ldquo;God is a Spirit:
and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Bible teaches about the worship
of the Bible church. The church which does these
five things in spirit and in truth is the right church
as far as the worship is concerned. A church might
be right in worship and wrong in doctrine, or vice
versa; but the church which, in spirit and in truth,
teaches and practices these five items and only these,
is right in its worship; and the church that preaches
and practices anything different from this is wrong.
The Bible is right. This is what the Bible teaches.
The church which does this is consequently right;
the one which doesn&rsquo;t is wrong.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Christian Living</span></h3>
<p>A church is responsible for its teaching in respect
to how its members should live. It cannot force the
members to do according to its teaching and we
must distinguish between the conduct of the church
as a whole and the behavior of individual members.
If the church teaches the truth and attempts to persuade
its members to obey it, and properly disciplines
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
them when they disobey, the church as a whole cannot
be held accountable for their misbehavior.</p>
<p>Concerning Christian living the Bible says, &ldquo;For
the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously
and godly in this present world&rdquo; (Titus 2:11-12).
&ldquo;Pure religion and undefiled before God and
the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows
in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world&rdquo; (Jas. 1:27). &ldquo;The first of all the commandments
is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is
one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the
first commandment. And the second is like, namely
this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There
is none other commandment greater than these&rdquo;
(Mark 12:29-31). And then in Matthew 7:12, we
have what is called the Golden Rule, &ldquo;Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are general commandments governing
Christian behavior, and the church which teaches
and impresses these Bible lessons upon its members
is right that far, but the church which fails to condemn
worldliness and ungodly living lacks that much
being right. It may be ever so sound on doctrine
and worship, but if it fails to properly admonish its
members and hold up before them the divine standard
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of Christian conduct and insist that they follow
it, it lacks that much being right.</p>
<p>Friends, here&rsquo;s (speaker points to board) what the
Bible teaches on Christian behavior. The church
which teaches this is right on that point because the
Bible is right and this is what the Bible says.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Name</span></h3>
<p>We come now to the name. You know, there are
a lot of churches right here in Nashville tonight
which simply cannot find their names in the Bible.
They could look from now till the end of the world
and they couldn&rsquo;t find the names they wear in the
Bible to save their lives! That, to me, is an astonishing
fact. It looks as if anybody ought to know that
the Bible cannot guide you into a church which isn&rsquo;t
even mentioned in the Bible. A road map cannot
direct you to a town which is not shown on the map.
A Tennessee road map cannot show you how to find
a town in Texas, and so the Bible cannot guide you
to a church which isn&rsquo;t even found in the Bible.
That&rsquo;s a very simple test which you might apply in
your search for the right church.</p>
<p>What does the Bible say about the name? In Ephesians
1:22 we find that Christ has been made head
over all things unto <i>the church</i>. Ephesians 5:25 says,
&ldquo;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved
the church and gave himself for it.&rdquo; And so, first of
all, it is simply called <i>the church</i>. Then in Revelation 1:4
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
we read about &ldquo;the seven <i>churches</i>&rdquo; of Asia,
meaning the seven different congregations which are
specified in chapters three and four. In a general
sense, including all saved people on the earth, it is
simply called <i>the church</i>. In the plural form this
name refers to the various local congregations of
that great body.</p>
<p>We learn also from First Corinthians 15:9 that it
is called the <i>church of God</i>. Paul said he was not fit
to be called an apostle, because he persecuted the
<i>church of God</i>. First Corinthians Cor 11:16 says, &ldquo;But if
any man seem to be contentious, we have no such
custom, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; So in the
singular and comprehensive sense, it is called the
<i>church of God</i>; not as a denominational title, but as
an expression of ownership. It is the church which
belongs to God. And in Matthew 16:18 Christ said,
&ldquo;Upon this rock I will build my church.&rdquo; It is, therefore,
the church which belongs to Christ. And in the
plural form, we read in Romans 16:16, &ldquo;The
churches of Christ salute you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friends, we learn from the Bible, then, that in the
broad, general sense, including all saved people, it is
called the church, or the church of God, or the
church of the Lord, the church which belongs to
Christ. Referring to different local congregations,
those same terms are used in the plural form. This
leads me to believe that anything bigger than a local
congregation and smaller than all God&rsquo;s people
throughout the world or some specific geographic
area, cannot scripturally be called <i>the church</i>. That&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
where denominationalism comes in. The only way
this universal institution can scripturally be broken
down into different parts is to do it on a geographical
or congregational basis. Splitting it up on any other
basis results in sectarianism or denominationalism&mdash;creates
different parties and sects.</p>
<p>I have two pictures drawn here to keep that before
your mind. Here&rsquo;s the Bible picture (speaker
points to board). The big ring includes all of God&rsquo;s
people throughout the entire world. These small dots
represent various congregations like the church at
Laodicea, the church at Smyrna, the church at Ephesus,
the church at Madison, the church at Chapel
Avenue, the church at Columbia, Tennessee, and
so on around the world&mdash;different local congregations.
This is purely a geographical grouping.</p>
<p>But here is the best figure I can draw on denominationalism
and it&rsquo;s not entirely accurate (speaker
points to board again). When a group of these congregations,
even if they have all been scripturally
baptized&mdash;which they have not&mdash;draw a ring about
themselves and say, &ldquo;We are the &lsquo;A&rsquo; Church,&rdquo; another
group says, &ldquo;We are the &lsquo;B&rsquo; Church,&rdquo; and another
says, &ldquo;We are the &lsquo;C&rsquo; Church,&rdquo; each group of
congregations distinguishing itself from other similar
groups by a distinguishing title&mdash;that is denominationalism,
pure and simple! That picture does <i>not</i>
represent a <i>geographic</i> distribution, for we have all
those different denominations right here in Nashville.
It&rsquo;s not a geographical division, but a division
based on difference in teaching, practice, and faith.
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
That&rsquo;s not the Bible picture (speaker continues to
refer to board). Here is the Bible picture.</p>
<p>The church which wears these Bible names, and
only these, is the right church as far as the name is
concerned. But, friends, any church that calls itself
by any other name, any name not in the Bible, is
not the right church because the Bible is right. When
a church has a name upon their building which cannot
be found in the Bible, they need not claim that
they are taking the Bible as their one and only guide,
for the very name on the church building denies that
claim. Just think how foolish it is for a preacher to
stand up and say, &ldquo;We take the Bible as our guide,&rdquo;
when, out in front of the building, in great big letters,
is a name which cannot even be found in the
Bible! That&rsquo;s one reason I think we had better examine
a man&rsquo;s claim to follow the Bible. Here&rsquo;s what
the Bible teaches on the name, and the Bible is right.
The church that wears these names and only these is
right on that point.</p>
<p>But merely wearing the right name will not make
a church right. It may wear the right name and still
be wrong in other respects. I used to preach in a
town where there was a great big church building
which had a name in bold letters that you could see
almost all over town&mdash;Central Church of Christ. But
if you went to their worship, you&rsquo;d find something
that&rsquo;s not listed here at all (speaker refers to section
of outline on board). They were not following the
Bible on worship. They had the right name but they
didn&rsquo;t have the right worship. They were right on
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
one point but wrong on another. There are churches
over the country called &ldquo;Churches of God.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a
good name, but they have items of doctrine that cannot
be found in the Bible. For instance, they preach
that you have to be baptized in the Holy Spirit in
order to be saved, and that&rsquo;s not in the Bible. Consequently,
they are wrong on doctrine; and to merely
wear the right name does not atone for their false
teaching on what one must do to be saved.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Organization</span></h3>
<p>Just one more item or two and then we&rsquo;re through.
Number 7 here refers to the organization of the
church. According to the Bible every local congregation
is entirely independent under God to manage
its own affairs, with its elders overseeing its work.
Acts 14:23: &ldquo;When they had ordained them elders
in every church and had prayed with fasting, they
commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.&rdquo;
Acts 20:28 says, &ldquo;Take heed therefore unto
yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the
Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the
church of God, which he hath purchased with his
own blood.&rdquo; In addressing the church at Philippi
Paul speaks of all the saints at Philippi &ldquo;with the
bishops and deacons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to this simple but effective organization
of God&rsquo;s church, every local congregation is entirely
independent, supervised and tended, under God, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
a group of men known as overseers or pastors or
elders. Now, that&rsquo;s what the Bible teaches on church
organization. The church which follows this plan is
right on that point. Wherever you see a group of congregations
tied together by some inter-congregational
organization, that group&rsquo;s wrong on their organization.
I know some groups that maintain congregational
independence, but are wrong in some other
way. Remember that in order for a church to be the
right church, it must be right on all these items.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Charity and Missionary Work</span></h3>
<p>And then, finally, the Bible teaches that God&rsquo;s
church should be active in beneficent and missionary
work. It is the duty of the church to feed the poor
and to preach the gospel unto the entire world. I
have a long list of Scriptures here which authorize
this statement (Acts 11:27-30; 12:25; 24:17; 1 Cor.
16:1-4; Acts 11:19-21; 11:22-26; 13:1-4; etc.). Even
though a church may be right in every other way,
including Christian living, including the name, and
including the organization, if it doesn&rsquo;t do what it
can to take care of the poor, and if it doesn&rsquo;t make
a scriptural effort to preach the gospel to all the
world, it lacks that much being right, and cannot
justify its claims to be known as the church of Christ!</p>
<p>Now, friends, let me repeat again that here&rsquo;s what
the Bible teaches. The church which does these
things is right, because the Bible is right; but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
church which deviates from these, leaves off some of
them or adds something to them, lacks that much
being right. And even though a church followed this
plan in every item except one, it would still be
wrong.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IX</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Conclusions</span></h3>
<p>What practical application shall we make? Simply
take your Bible and follow out this plan, study it for
yourself, see that this is what the Bible teaches, and
then identify yourself with the congregation which
does the same. You say, &ldquo;Maybe I cannot find one
that follows the Bible plan.&rdquo; I believe you can in
this town, but I&rsquo;ll admit there are some towns where
you can&rsquo;t. Then what would you do? The answer is
very simple&mdash;just start one! That&rsquo;s one of the easiest
things in the world to do. Study your Bible, follow
its simple pattern, and the result will be a church
after the New Testament order. If you can find even
one person who is willing to follow this plan and
work it with you, then you&rsquo;ll have a congregation
which pleases God. Jesus says, &ldquo;Wherever two or
three are gathered together in my name, there will
I be in the midst of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, friends, I believe that the most practical and
effective missionary work that we could possibly do
would be for all church members who move away
from Nashville and other places where the church
is strong, to faithfully and persistently follow this
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
Bible program wherever they go, even though they
have to meet and worship in their own homes. There
are too many who forsake this plan when they go
away to a strange city.</p>
<p>If all who move away from places where the church
is strong, would simply take Christ and the Bible
with them and start a congregation wherever they
go, it would be the most far-reaching, the most effective,
the most practical, and the most economical
missionary work that could possibly be conceived!
It would not only be all of that, it would also be
scriptural. What more could you expect? That certainly
is enough to recommend it to us all. So,
friends, simply take this plan, if you know of a congregation
that&rsquo;s following it, then identify yourself
with it. If you can&rsquo;t find one, then start one, with
the determination to follow the Bible; and then
you&rsquo;ll be in the right church. You may forget about
all these 200 different denominations, except to do
whatever you can to lead them out of error into the
truth!</p>
<p>I told you I would do no boasting tonight and I
shall do none, but I will say this: I sincerely believe
it is the earnest determination of the congregation
at Chapel Avenue to follow this simple Bible plan,
and I believe I speak the truth when I say that if
you can point out to the overseers of this congregation
that they are failing to follow the Bible on any
single item, they will change their practice immediately.
That should be the attitude of everyone
who loves the truth, and they will not embarrass you
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
or rebuff you if you approach them on the question.
If you even <i>think</i> they are failing on some point, they
would welcome an interview and pledge themselves
to make any sort of alteration or change that is necessary
to bring the teaching, the practice, and the
name of this congregation into harmony with the
Bible plan. If that were not true, I would not continue
to preach for this group except long enough
to do what I could to get them to reform.</p>
<p>Friends, above everything else, I want to go to
heaven when I die and I know that the only way to
do that is to follow the Bible; so I still insist that it
is entirely proper and appropriate to emphasize that
the church which follows the Bible is the one that&rsquo;s
right. This simple test, if faithfully and honestly applied,
will eliminate every church in this town which
cannot find its name, its doctrine, and its practice
in the Bible. Are you willing to live up to the claim
that you take that Bible as your one and only guide?
If so, just follow this (speaker refers to outline on
the board) step by step, believe that Jesus is the
Christ, repent of your sins, confess your faith, and
then be baptized for remission of sins. Then go on,
worshiping God as the Bible directs, behaving yourself
as the Bible teaches, supporting the church which
wears the right name, which is scripturally organized,
and which takes the Bible as its one and only guide.</p>
<p>If, after having been scripturally baptized, you
have failed on one or more of these items, the Bible
teaches that if you will repent, confess your sins and
pray for forgiveness, God will surely forgive you. As
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
we stand and sing the song announced, we entreat
you to accept the invitation of our Lord, who says,
&ldquo;Come unto me and I will give you rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">VI</span>
<br />WHY NOT BE JUST A CHRISTIAN?</h2>
<p>Religious people seem to realize more keenly than
before the importance and even necessity of Christian
unity. But before we can have the unity which
the Bible teaches and demands, some practical means
of attaining it must be employed. It seems to me that
it would be well to begin by emphasizing some points
of agreement&mdash;in other words, let us see how close
together we are, at present, and then we will be in
better position to discuss the points of difference. I
believe in religious debates, have engaged in such
myself and shall be glad to do so again whenever the
opportunity presents itself, but in this sermon I want
to emphasize the truth upon which most religious
people are already agreed.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Points of Agreement</span></h3>
<p>I believe we can say that most of those who claim
to be followers of Christ are agreed upon the following
points:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>A. <i>General Statements</i></dt>
<dd>1. God is.</dd>
<dd>2. The Bible is His word written by men as they were guided by the Holy Spirit.</dd>
<dd>3. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.</dd>
<dd>4. The world needs a Savior and has no power by which to redeem itself from sin.</dd>
<dd>5. Redemption or salvation is to be had through Christ and only through Him.</dd>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_103">103</dt>
<dt>B. <i>The Plan of Salvation</i></dt></dl>
<p>If we agree upon these five points, then, we also
agree that there is a plan of salvation, for these points
imply such a plan. It may be that we can get closer
together upon the items of this plan than you have
thought we could. We will all agree that faith is the
very foundation of the plan (John 3:16). All accept
the fact that repentance is essential (Acts 17:30).
Everyone agrees that the plan of salvation includes
the confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the
Living God (Matt. 10:32, Acts 8:37, Rom. 10:10).
Some make additions to this simple Biblical confession,
but I have never heard of anyone&rsquo;s subtracting
from it. When the comprehensiveness of the term
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; is understood, it is obvious that no additions
are needed. Everyone who agrees on the foregoing
will also agree that Jesus commanded baptism
and promised salvation to those who believed and
were baptized. &ldquo;He that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be
damned&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). We will all agree that Peter
said, as the Holy Spirit prompted him, &ldquo;Repent, and
be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). We will agree
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
that Ananias said to Paul, &ldquo;And now why tarriest
thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
calling on the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts 22:16), and
also that the Holy Spirit said through the Apostle
Peter, &ldquo;The like figure whereunto even baptism doth
also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of
the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward
God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Peter
3:21). It is also generally agreed that when one has
been immersed he has been baptized. There are some
who believe that sprinkling or pouring will do as
well, but all agree that immersion is safe. Furthermore,
it is generally agreed that when one believes
and repents, confesses his faith, and is immersed for
the remission of sins in the name of Christ, he is
saved. Some believe one is saved before completing
this program, but all will agree that he is saved when
he has completed it. So here again we find the ground
of unity.</p>
<p>C. <i>Christian Worship</i></p>
<p>The next question is, &ldquo;What should one do by way
of worship and Christian service after becoming a
Christian?&rdquo; In these realms, also, there are many
important points of agreement. In reference to public
worship all will agree that it is proper for Christians
to meet upon the first day of the week and
sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and make
melody in their hearts unto the Lord; lay by in store
as they have been prospered; pray unto their Father
in heaven; teach and be taught; and eat the Lord&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
Supper in memory of Him who died for them. Some
dare to add to these items of worship, some dare to
subtract from them; but all agree that they are scriptural
and sufficient. When Christians come together
upon the first day of each week and perform these
five Biblical items of worship to God, doing so in
spirit and in truth, they know that their worship has
pleased their Maker and Redeemer. This, then, is
the ground of unity in our worship on the Lord&rsquo;s
Day. In such a program all Christians could take part
and go away believing that they had done all that was
required and nothing that was condemned.</p>
<p>D. <i>Christian Service</i></p>
<p>In reference to Christian service there is general
agreement upon the broad principles that should
govern. Everyone will subscribe to the Golden Rule
(Luke 6:31) and to the Royal Law (Jas. 2:8). We
agree that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly and righteously and godly in this
present world, that we should love our neighbors
as ourselves, and that we should do unto others as
we would have them do unto us.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Sufficiency of the Plan</span></h3>
<p>The above is a brief outline, then, of points upon
which there is very general agreement. Let me ask
you, dear friend, if you can think of anything essential
to salvation which is not covered, at least in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
general way, in this outline. If one follows the plan
presented here, do you not agree that he will be
saved in heaven at last? Can you think of anything
else which is needed to insure one&rsquo;s eternal salvation?
I believe you cannot.</p>
<p>Upon the sufficiency of this plan I am sure we are
agreed. This being true, would it not be wrong to
include anything else? Would it not be wrong to
insist upon adding something to this simple Bible
plan and thereby cause division and destroy the possibility
of the unity that the Bible requires? If the
above plan is sufficient to take one to heaven, what
more do you desire? Why add anything to it? Would
it not be wrong to add anything else?</p>
<p>Another question: &ldquo;What will the following of
this plan make of one?&rdquo; I am sure we will also agree
that it will make him a Christian and only a Christian.
Let it be noted that one can do all that is suggested
above and which we have agreed to be sufficient
unto salvation without belonging to any denomination.
You can believe, repent, confess your
sins, and be baptized without belonging to any denomination.
You who have done so can meet in
groups upon the first day of the week and worship
God as the Bible directs without becoming members
of any denomination, and you can certainly perform
your duties in the field of Christian service without
joining a denomination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">More Points of Agreement</span></h3>
<p>But while we are in this agreeing business, let us
take it even further. In this country there is a large
religious community known as the Baptist Church.
This group includes many fine people. Many of
them are honest, intelligent, cultured, refined, and
good citizens. They have taken their denominational
title from their emphasis upon immersion as being
the only scriptural baptism, in contrast to those who
accept something else. I agree with the Baptists that
immersion is baptism and that nothing short of immersion
will meet the definition of baptism found in
Romans 6:4 or Colossians 2:12. I agree with them
that the Greek word &ldquo;baptidzo&rdquo; is properly translated
by the word &ldquo;immerse.&rdquo; But I can agree with
them upon this great truth without belonging to the
Baptist denomination. I can fully accept the very
truth from which the Baptist Church has taken its
name and still be just a Christian.</p>
<p>The Methodist Church is one of the largest in this
country. I have more kinspeople in that denomination
than in any other. For all of their good points
I give them due respect and credit. Because of their
insistence upon method and system in their religious
work, they were nicknamed Methodists many years
ago. This name was later accepted by them as their
denominational title. I agree with the Methodists
that system and method are important. I endeavor to
be systematic and orderly in every phase of my work
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
and activity. I believe that the Lord&rsquo;s work should
be carried on orderly. &ldquo;Let everything be done in
decency and in order&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:40). We should use
order, then. We should use the Bible order. But one
can certainly do this without belonging to the Methodist
Church.</p>
<p>Why should one exalt the name of this one aspect
of Christian activity to the point of adopting it as a
religious title? One can be methodical without being
a Methodist. Just as one can be systematic without
being a Systematist. One can be just a plain Christian
and practice everything the Bible teaches in reference
to order and system.</p>
<p>When I was attending the Union Theological Seminary,
one of my professors told me that the New
Testament churches were &ldquo;congregational presbyterian.&rdquo;
He explained his statement by saying that
each congregation was independent of all other congregations
and that each was overseen by a group of
men known as elders or presbyters. I agree with him
exactly. According to his explanation his statement
was entirely correct. But I am not a member of the
Presbyterian Church. One can believe all the Bible
teaches upon the presbytery and practice the same
without belonging to the Presbyterian denomination.
Why should this characteristic of church government
or organization be exalted by using it as a religious
or denominational title? One can be just a Christian
and still believe and practice what the Bible teaches
in reference to the presbytery. One does not have
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
to be a member of the Presbyterian Church to obey
God concerning the presbytery.</p>
<p>One can believe in the universality of the Gospel
without being a Catholic or Universalist. One can
believe in the second coming of Christ without belonging
to the Adventist denomination. One can
teach and practice holy living without belonging to
the Holiness Church. If one had to join the Baptist
Church because he believed in baptism and the
Methodist Church because he believed in method
and the Presbyterian Church because he believed in
the presbytery of the local congregation (1 Tim. 4:14)
and so on down the list, what would he be when
he had finished? One can agree with the denominations
on the very truth from which they have taken
their names, insofar as they have taken their names
from truth, without belonging to any of them.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Some Important Conclusions</span></h3>
<p>One can believe all truth and obey every commandment
of God without belonging to any denomination.
Can you think of an exception to this statement?
Can you think of any truth which you cannot
believe or any commandment that you cannot obey
without joining a denomination? I don&rsquo;t believe you
can. Can you think of any truth which you cannot
accept or any commandment which you cannot obey
while being just a Christian?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it sufficient to be just a Christian? Isn&rsquo;t it
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
wrong to be something different from or more than
a Christian? Since one can be a Christian without
joining any denomination, then why join one?
Would it not be wrong to join one, since denominationalism
is division and division is wrong? Let me
emphasize the statement that I can believe all truth
either in the Bible or out of the Bible and obey every
commandment of the Lord without joining any denomination.</p>
<p>This being true, what then does it take to make
one a member of a denomination? Believing truth
will not make one a member of a denomination, because
he can believe all truth on the outside. Obeying
God will not make one a member of a denomination,
because he can obey God on the outside. If
believing truth and obeying God will not make one
a member of a denomination, then what will do so?</p>
<p>To become a member of a denomination, it is obvious
that one must believe something besides the
truth or do something besides obey God. Since believing
all truth and obeying all God&rsquo;s commands
will not put one in a denomination, then he must
believe something different from the truth and do
something which God has not commanded or leave
off something which He has commanded, in order to
become a member of a denomination. It seems to me
that these conclusions are inevitable and unanswerable.</p>
<p>But it may be that some of my hearers are already
in some denomination; hence, I raise this question:
&ldquo;What must you do to get out of a denomination?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
The answer is, retrace the steps which you took in
going into it. Some seem to think that in order to
give up denominationalism and to be just Christians
that they will have to forsake all that they have ever
held as dear and precious in the field of religion.
This is a mistake. Believing truth did not put you
into a denomination. In order to come out of it, you
will not have to forsake any truth. It will only be
necessary for you to reject the error which you accepted
in becoming a member of a denomination.</p>
<p>In order to come out of a denomination, you will
not have to cease obeying God upon any point. It
will only be necessary for you to change your conduct
on those points where you have been disobeying
Him. Since believing truth did not put you in, you
will not have to forsake truth in coming out. Merely
give up the error that you accepted, believe the truth
revealed in the Bible and obey God; then you will
be a Christian, not a denominationalist.</p>
<p>In order to come out of a denomination, you will
not have to quit believing that God is, that the Bible
is His word, that Jesus is His Son and the Savior
of the world. You will not have to quit believing in,
and teaching, and practicing, faith, repentance, confession
and baptism as the conditions of salvation.
You will not have to forsake any of the five items of
worship outlined in the Bible. You will not have to
forsake any scriptural service to your fellow-man.</p>
<p>Again I repeat, one can believe all truth, obey
every command of God, be a Christian, live the
Christian life, die in the Lord and be saved forever
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
without belonging to any denomination. Since it is
unnecessary to be a member of a denomination, it is
wrong to be so. Any non-essential which causes division
is wrong. &ldquo;Come out from among them and
be ye separate, saith the Lord. Touch no unclean
thing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 6:17). &ldquo;Yet if any man suffer as a
Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify
God on this behalf&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:16). &ldquo;Neither is
there salvation in any other: for there is none other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we
must be saved&rdquo; (Acts 4:12).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">VII</span>
<br />EXCUSES</h2>
<p>At this season of the year we frequently say something
about the custom of making resolutions. It is
a mighty good custom, provided we make the right
sort of resolutions and endeavor to keep them. I
would like to encourage you to resolve to do more
for the Lord this year than you have ever done
before. Such a resolution could be broken down
into many elements, but, especially, may I urge that
each of you make it your goal to lead at least one
person to obey the gospel during the year that has
just begun.</p>
<p>We have more than 500 members. If each member
would lead some person to Christ during this year,
it would mean more than 500 additions. That would
be the most glorious year&rsquo;s work this congregation
has ever had. With the co-operation of every member,
this goal can be reached. Surely there is someone
in Nashville with whom you have enough influence
to lead him to Christ, provided you are willing
to fully dedicate yourself to the Lord and behave
yourself each day in the way that will give you the
greatest amount of power and influence for good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">A Great Supper</span></h3>
<p>I am not going to speak this morning upon new
year&rsquo;s resolutions. But I shall say something which
I believe will help you in carrying out the resolution
that has just been mentioned. For our text we go to
the fourteenth chapter of Luke, and begin reading
with verse 15. &ldquo;And when one of them that sat at
meat with him heard these things, he said unto him,
Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
God. Then said he unto him, A certain man made
a great supper, and bade many: and sent his servant
at supper time to say to them that were bidden,
Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with
one consent began to make excuse. The first said
unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I
must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
And another said, I have bought five yoke of
oxen, and I go to prove them. I pray thee have me
excused. And another said, I have married a wife,
and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came,
and showed his lord these things. Then the master
of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring me hither the poor, and the maimed, and the
halt, and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is
done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
And the Lord said unto the servant, Go out into the
highways and hedges and compel them to come in
that my house may be filled. For I say unto you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
That none of those men which were bidden shall
taste of my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Three Slackers</span></h3>
<p>According to the social customs which are said to
have prevailed at that time and in the light of this
text, it appears that the men in this story had already
received and accepted the original invitation to attend
this great supper. The servant was sent to tell
those who were bidden that supper was now served.
In spite of their social obligation to attend, they
began to make excuse.</p>
<p>1. The nature of their excuses is not very commendable.
The first one said he had bought a piece
of land and he was going to see it. I don&rsquo;t believe he
bought that land without having already seen it. Such
things sometimes happen but not often. He had
probably walked over the farm very thoroughly before
he agreed to buy it. He was simply making an
excuse and he is not the last man who has allowed
a piece of land to keep him away from duty.</p>
<p>I was brought up in the country and I have known
men to work on their farms six days a week from
early in the morning until late in the evening and
then on Sunday morning they just had to walk over
the fields before they could go to worship. They
would get out in the grass and in the dew and get
their clothes wet and come in late, too late to go to
Bible school, or maybe even too late to get to worship
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
at all. Of course, such conduct is not acceptable in
the sight of God.</p>
<p>2. The next man said he had bought five yoke of
oxen and must needs go and try them. I believe
again that he had already tried them or by some
other means knew whether they would work. He
could have attended the feast if he had wanted to
do so, but he simply preferred to be out with his
oxen rather than to carry out the promise which he
had made.</p>
<p>3. The third man merely said, &ldquo;I have married a
wife and therefore I cannot come.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even
say, &ldquo;I beg thee have me excused.&rdquo; He made no apology.
He thought the fact that he had a wife was
excuse enough for falling down on his duties. He is
not the last man who has allowed a wife to keep him
from doing his duty. That has happened many
times. Sometimes it works the other way. The wife
allows her husband to keep her from doing what
she ought to do.</p>
<p>You and I regard none of these excuses as being
valid. Neither did the master of the house. He was
angry. He would allow none of these deserters to
taste his supper. He didn&rsquo;t even propose to make any
allowance for repentance. He, no doubt, felt that he
had been greatly mistreated or even insulted. But
these excuses were no worse than many of those
which people now offer for rejecting the Lord&rsquo;s invitation.
Even church members sometimes give silly
excuses for not doing their duty.</p>

<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Common Excuses</span></h3>
<p>This morning we want to discuss the excuses
outsiders offer for not obeying the gospel.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
If you start out to do some personal work and to lead
people to the Lord individually, and that is the most
effective way to lead them, you&rsquo;ll find them making
excuses. There are twelve or fifteen excuses which
will probably cover 95 per cent of the cases. If you
become familiar with these, and know how to answer
them, you&rsquo;ll be able to handle most of the objections
you meet. I have heard all these excuses offered many
times. If you set out to do some work tomorrow&mdash;work
of this nature&mdash;you will find people offering
one or more of these excuses. Let us state and briefly
discuss them.</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;<i>There are so many doctrines preached I do
not know which one to believe. If wise men differ
about which church is right, how then can I be
sure?</i>&rdquo; Well, friends, wise men are still differing
about what sort of food you ought to eat. The doctors
have not yet decided what is the perfect diet;
but you haven&rsquo;t quit eating while the doctors argue.
You are more practical in dealing with your stomach
than you are in dealing with your soul. You keep
on eating the best you can while the scientists search
for the perfect diet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I never heard anyone offer this excuse
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
who was a Bible student. It is always offered by
those who do not study the Bible, because anyone
who is able to study can find the answer. I could
entertain you at length, and maybe profit you as
well, by giving you a number of examples of individuals
who have studied the Bible independently
in search for the truth, with always the same results.
Anyone who will take the time to investigate God&rsquo;s
word, doing his best to lay aside his prejudice and
his bias, if he is sincere and honest, will be able to
understand God&rsquo;s will well enough to obey the Lord
on this earth and be saved everlastingly. The man
who offers this excuse is simply not willing to make
the investigation necessary to gain the enlightenment
or information which he needs.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;<i>For me to be baptized for remission of sins
would be to say that my parents are lost.</i>&rdquo; Of course,
that implies that his parents are already dead and
that they were never baptized for remission of sins.
I answer this objection by giving a concrete example.
I visited a lady in West Virginia and anticipated that
she would make this excuse. In fact, when I entered
the room I could see the tenseness in the muscles of
her face. She was expecting me to say that her father
had gone to hell, and she was all set to get angry
when I did. But I disappointed her. I didn&rsquo;t say it.
I have never said that to anyone. I do not see how
it can do any good. There may be times when I am
convinced that it is so. But after one is dead there
is no need to discuss it.</p>
<p>My approach was this: &ldquo;I am willing to admit that
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
your father was just as good as you think he was.
There is no reason why I should deny this. But remember,
if your father was as good as you think he
was, then he did the best he knew, he lived up to
all the enlightenment he had; because if he had not
done so, he would not have been a good man. He
would have been a hypocrite. So we will just assume
that your father did the very best he could. Then
you are not as good as he was unless you do the very
best that you know, and you know that you ought
to be a Christian. You know you ought to be a member
of the church we read about in the Bible. You
know that you ought to be baptized for remission
of sins. If you don&rsquo;t obey the gospel, then you are
not as good as you say your father was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tenseness left her face. She relaxed and talked
more reasonably. Before the meeting closed she
obeyed the gospel. If your father and mother are
dead, if they are on their way to heaven, and if they
are conscious, then they certainly want you to obey
the gospel so you will go there, too. If they are not on
their way to heaven, if they are conscious of being on
their way to the other place, then they certainly
want you to obey the gospel, for torment in fire is
one misery which is so terrible that it does not love
company. The rich man did not want his brothers
to come to the place where he was in hades.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;<i>I am better now than some of those who are
in the church.</i>&rdquo; In a sense that might be so. Morally
you might be better than the worst hypocrite in the
church, but why do you want to select the lowest
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
standard that you can find? I have often wondered
why a decent man will select a hypocrite in the
church, or an immoral, disloyal, unfaithful church
member as a standard by which to measure himself.
To do so is certainly no compliment to yourself. We
do not use such standards in other matters. We want
the best standards in the affairs of this world and
even though your comparison be true, it still remains
that the best man in the church is far better than
the best man on the outside. And the average man
in the church is better than the average man on the
outside. Furthermore, when you stand before the
Lord Jesus Christ you will not be judged according
to any human standard, but according to the word
of God Almighty.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;<i>There are so many hypocrites in the church
that I cannot afford to become a member of it.</i>&rdquo;
When one makes this excuse I don&rsquo;t say, but I feel
like saying, &ldquo;Well, come on in, brother; there is always
room for one more.&rdquo; The man who offers that
excuse is a hypocrite himself. That&rsquo;s not what keeps
him out. It is just an excuse for not coming in. Furthermore,
there are hypocrites in every organization
in the world. There are hypocrites outside the
church. You can&rsquo;t get away from the hypocrites by
staying outside the church, because they are not all
inside the church. The church doesn&rsquo;t have a monopoly
on them. Most of them are still on the outside,
and you will be with them as long as you remain
there. Furthermore you&rsquo;ll have to spend eternity
with all the hypocrites, those that are now in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
church and those that are now outside the church.
So, if you want to get away from hypocrites, there is
only one way to do it: become a Christian and tolerate
the few hypocrites in the church while on this
earth you dwell, then go home to heaven to be free
of all of them forever.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m not good enough to be a Christian.</i>&rdquo; If you
were, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to become one. The gospel
is for people who need to be better. The gospel is
for sinners. Sinners are the raw material out of which
Christians are made. The people who were saved on
the day of Pentecost were not such good folk to start
with. They were murderers. They had murdered the
Son of God. Yet they could be saved. If you are not
worse than the men who, with wicked and lawless
hands, nailed the Son of God to the cross, then you
are not too mean to be saved. In fact, Christ is able
to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
him. His power is not limited. One of the most wonderful
things about the gospel of Jesus Christ is that
it makes no difference how dark or black your record
may have been in the past, you can have it washed
clean and white as snow in the blood of the Lamb.
His blood is able to wipe away all your sins; though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool;
though they be as scarlet they shall be as white as
snow (Isa. 1:18). There is no one too wicked to be
saved if he is willing to believe in Christ, repent of
his sins, obey the commandment to be baptized, and
remain faithful thereafter.</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;<i>Well, I&rsquo;d like to become a Christian, but I&rsquo;m</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
<i>afraid I can&rsquo;t hold out.</i>&rdquo; People say a lot of things
they don&rsquo;t mean to say. They use a lot of words
sometimes when they don&rsquo;t realize what they are
saying. So does the man who makes this excuse. Let&rsquo;s
just look at it a minute and see what a fellow really
says when he states that he is afraid he can&rsquo;t hold out.
If you analyze his excuse, it simply means this: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
on my way to hell and there is nothing I can do
about it.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t mean to say that. He didn&rsquo;t
intend to assume such a hopeless attitude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
on my way to hell and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about
it.&rdquo; Why nobody, not many people at least, believes
that! And yet that&rsquo;s virtually what you say when you
say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be a Christian, but I am afraid I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God is not the author of such hopelessness. The
Bible says, &ldquo;Whosoever will let him take the water of
life freely&rdquo; (Rev. 22:17). The Bible teaches that God
&ldquo;will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
able, but will with the temptation also make a way
to escape that ye may be able to bear it&rdquo; (1 Cor.
10:13). The Bible plainly declares that all of those
who will may come. Anybody who is willing to try
can be saved. To say it is impossible for you to be
saved is to dispute the word of God Almighty. I do
not believe you really want to do that.</p>
<p>7. &ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t know enough yet.</i>&rdquo; That could be so.
I think I have seen some people of whom that was
true. But you can learn enough in a very few minutes.
Do you know that in every example of conversion
we have in the Bible, the people who were saved
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
obeyed the first sermon they heard? In every case!
Now, if those people who lived nearly 2000 years ago
could learn enough from one sermon to obey the
gospel, how long should it take one today? In every
instance they obeyed the first sermon they heard.
It didn&rsquo;t take long, did it? I have worked with people
whom I had to teach for a full year before they
would obey the gospel. Of course, I admit that I am
not as good a teacher as Peter or Paul, but when I
read to you just what those men said, then, after all,
they are doing the teaching. People of that day
could learn enough from them in just an hour or so
to obey the gospel. Surely it ought not to take one
several years now to learn the same. After all, you
don&rsquo;t need to know much to be saved. You don&rsquo;t
need to know everything. If you wait till you know
everything before you do anything, then you&rsquo;ll always
do nothing.</p>
<p>In order to be saved, you simply need to know
that you are lost, that Jesus is able to save you, and
what he wants you to do in order that he may save
you. I can tell you that in less than a minute! &ldquo;He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark
16:16). &ldquo;Repent and be baptized everyone of you
in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (Acts
2:38). Now, that is enough if you are willing to accept
it and obey it. Even if you didn&rsquo;t know it when
you came, you now know enough to be saved.</p>
<p>An illustration which I frequently use is this: Suppose
I start to drive to Columbia, Tennessee, tonight.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
I get out here on the street and say, &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t
see the way to Columbia. There are many crooks
and turns and ditches between here and Columbia.
I might have a wreck and kill myself, so I just won&rsquo;t
start.&rdquo; That would be silly, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Why, I could
see a few yards ahead of me and I would drive on in
what light I had. As I moved on the light would
move on and if I kept on going, I would likely reach
Columbia or any other place to which I started.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it is in going to heaven; you can&rsquo;t
see your way from here into the Pearly Gates. If
you could, you would be walking by sight and not
by faith. &ldquo;But the just shall live by faith&rdquo; (Hab.
2:4). You can see the first step, and if you will take
it, you will be able to see a little bit further. Take
the second and then you can see still further, and if
you keep on going, you will reach the goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man will do His will, he shall know of
the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I
speak of myself&rdquo; (John 7:17). They that will to do
His will shall know. You can see or learn the way
as you go along. Remember this, if you know of just
one commandment that you have not yet obeyed,
you do not deserve to understand another until
you are willing to obey the one you do understand.
If a man does not love the truth, God will send him
strong delusions that he may believe a lie and be
damned (2 Thess. 2:8-12). If you know truth and
are unwilling to act upon it, you do not deserve to
know any further truth. If you keep on despising
what truth you do have, then God will take even
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
that away from you. He will send you a strong delusion
that you may be deceived, may be deluded
and may be damned forever. It is a dangerous thing
for one to trample under his foot the word of Almighty
God. If you know of even one commandment
which you have not obeyed, obey it now.</p>
<p>8. &ldquo;<i>I live a good, clean life, I treat everybody right.
I pay all my debts, I tell the truth, I am loyal and
faithful to my family, and I am just as good as a lot
of those folk in the church. The church can&rsquo;t save
you anyhow, so I think I am all right.</i>&rdquo; Now, you
know the answer to that, don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s found in the
tenth chapter of Acts. I always like to suggest that
the man who makes that sort of a statement compare
himself with Cornelius. He was a just man. He treated
everybody right. He feared the Lord. He prayed
to God always. He was charitable. He gave much
alms to the poor. And he was such a good man he had
won the favor of the Jews over whom he was serving
as the head of an army of occupation! He had a good
reputation, even among them. Yet he was not good
enough to go to heaven without obeying the gospel.
He was told to send for Peter, who would speak
unto him words whereby he should be saved. He was
not yet saved.</p>
<p>If you have ever committed just one sin, you cannot
go to heaven until that sin is washed away by
the blood of Jesus, for sin cannot enter there. Surely
there is no one who would say that he had never
committed one sin. You don&rsquo;t have to commit a
great big catalogue of sins in order to be lost. Just
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
one unforgiven sin will take you into torment. If
you&rsquo;ve ever done wrong on a single point, then
you&rsquo;ll have to repent of that and obey the gospel
in order to go to heaven when you die.</p>
<p>9. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m waiting for someone else. I&rsquo;m afraid my
parents or husband or wife would object. This religion
is unpopular and would cause me to lose my
social standing.</i>&rdquo; This is really three excuses in one,
but in each case the person is being influenced by
what someone else thinks, instead of being influenced
by what God says. A familiar answer to such excuses
is that every tub shall set on its own bottom. You&rsquo;ll
find that in Romans, chapter 14 and verse 12, &ldquo;So
then each one of us must give an account of himself
unto the Lord.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;tub,&rdquo; but
it says the same thing. &ldquo;So then each one of us must
give an account of himself unto the Lord.&rdquo; When
you get to the judgment day, neither your father nor
your mother, brother nor sister, husband nor wife&mdash;nobody
else can answer for you. Therefore, no one
else should be allowed to <i>live</i> for you. No one should
be allowed to make your choices or decisions because
they cannot answer for you.</p>
<p>Someone made a remark that one of the nice things
about the Catholic Church was that the members
allowed the priests to make all the decisions, that
they rather expected him to make their choices for
them. My answer was that that would be all right
if the priest could also answer for you. But the priest
cannot answer for you. Therefore, you&rsquo;d better not
let him make your decisions. He might not make
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
a decision that you would want to stand by on the
judgment day. Nobody can answer for you, therefore
nobody should be allowed to choose your course.
In the light of God&rsquo;s word you must accept that responsibility
yourself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you want to get your husband,
wife, or somebody else to obey the gospel, the way
to get them to do it is not to wait for them but go
ahead and lead the way. Step out and do it yourself.
In West Virginia a lady told me that she would obey
the gospel but that she was waiting for her husband.
I knew that was not a good excuse and I tried to get
her to see it. One evening while we were singing the
invitation song I stopped and made this remark, &ldquo;If
I were you, I&rsquo;d rather go to heaven alone than to go
to hell with my husband.&rdquo; Evidently she knew that
I was talking about her, for when we began to sing
again she came down the aisle. The next day her
husband also came. If she had waited for him, they
might both still be on the outside. Now they are
two of the most faithful members in the congregation.</p>
<p>A lady at Madison, Tennessee, made the same excuse.
She even went so far as to say, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just
talk to my husband and get him to obey, then I&rsquo;ll
come along with him.&rdquo; I told her that wasn&rsquo;t the
right attitude. The next Sunday at church she came
down the aisle to make the confession and be baptized.
When I met her, she stopped and whispered to
me, &ldquo;Brother Dark, I wish you would go back and
talk to my husband.&rdquo; He was just two steps behind
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
her and she didn&rsquo;t know it. That&rsquo;s the way to get your
husband to come! That&rsquo;s the way to get your wife to
come! If you wait for somebody else, then you&rsquo;ll be
lost.</p>
<p>There was a lady in Chattanooga who didn&rsquo;t wait
for her husband. She went to church. Her husband
tried to keep her from going. That&rsquo;s unusual. Most
husbands like for their wives to be good whether
they are or not. But this husband didn&rsquo;t want his
wife to go to church. He told her she couldn&rsquo;t have
any money to give to the church. She began to take
in sewing to make money for her contributions.
That made him angry. He said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use
that sewing machine, I paid for it.&rdquo; So she just
kept on going without any money to contribute.
He saw that he was defeated on that point so, in desperation,
he locked up her wardrobe. He said, &ldquo;I
paid for those Sunday dresses and you can&rsquo;t wear
them to church.&rdquo; She defied him again and borrowed
some dresses from the next door neighbor and other
ladies in the church and just kept on going anyway.
He felt like he had to do something about it, so
he went over to the meetinghouse to see if he could
find out what could be done. He stood on the outside
and listened. It didn&rsquo;t sound as bad as he thought
it would. Before the meeting closed he was baptized.
Suppose his wife had been fainthearted and had refused
to go ahead without her husband. He now says
that he used to be the meanest man in Chattanooga
and I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with him.</p>
<p>I heard another story of a lady who was influenced
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
by her husband. She was attending a revival meeting
and he was going with her every night. One night
while they were dressing, she said something about
going to church, and he said, &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not going
to church tonight, we&rsquo;re going to the show.&rdquo; She
replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to a show. The revival is going
on. You know that! I have to be over there!&rdquo; He
said, &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re going to a show.&rdquo; She kept on insisting
that they go to church and he kept on insisting
on going to the show. Finally he said, &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ve
been going with you every night, and it&rsquo;s only fair
that you go with me tonight.&rdquo; She still refused. Then
he said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go with me tonight, I&rsquo;m not
going with you any more.&rdquo; So she gave in.</p>
<p>On the way to town he stopped beside the road.
His wife asked him what was wrong. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to the show. I just wanted to test you out.
I was planning to obey the gospel. If this thing is as
important as you and your preacher say it is, then
you ought to have gone on tonight regardless of what
I did. Before I accepted I thought I would test you
out.&rdquo; I admit that he treated her pretty rough; but
after all, you can&rsquo;t afford to let even the person
whom you love best on this earth keep you from
doing that which is right. It would be an act of unkindness.
If you love someone, you ought not to let
him keep you from doing right but you ought to go
on anyhow and use your influence to get him to
come along with you.</p>
<p>10. &ldquo;<i>There is plenty of time yet.</i>&rdquo; This one will
probably take more people to hell than all the others
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
put together. Procrastination is the thief of souls. I&rsquo;ve
never talked to but one person who said he planned
to die and go to hell. Others say, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to
change my ways. I know that I&rsquo;m lost and I&rsquo;m going
to change.&rdquo; But when? &ldquo;Well, sometime.&rdquo; A man
who talks like that never gets it done. When I go
into a man&rsquo;s home, talk to him, and urge him to obey
the gospel and he says, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to think it
over; I&rsquo;m glad you came and I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; I
go away without much encouragement. But if a person
tells me, &ldquo;Yes, Brother Dark, I&rsquo;ll be over there
next Sunday night and be baptized,&rdquo; then I know
something is going to happen. That is the only way
to overcome the tendency to procrastinate.</p>
<p>I talked to some people at Madison one evening
about 5 <span class="smaller">P.M.</span> Immediately upon entering the room
I learned that they knew what they ought to do.
They had attended our meeting often and they knew
that they ought to be baptized. They understood the
plan of salvation. I remarked to them that one could
get into the habit of procrastinating. I said, &ldquo;Every
time you repeat the act of putting this thing off this
habit becomes stronger. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, it may
get you bound so tightly that you will never overcome
it.&rdquo; They came forward that night and obeyed
the gospel, less than three hours after I had talked
to them, and are now two of the most faithful members
in the church. Afterwards the man told me that
the remark about procrastination had prompted him
to act immediately. He realized that he had got into
the habit of putting it off. This habit was getting
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
stronger and stronger. He had to exert his will
power to overcome it.</p>
<p>None of these excuses are any good. They will
not stand the test of the judgment. I doubt that you
would even have the audacity to mention them before
God. There is no excuse for failing, or for delaying,
to do what you know God has commanded.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Best Resolution</span></h3>
<p>The best resolution that you can make today, if
you haven&rsquo;t already made it, is the resolution to quit
doing wrong and to begin doing right. It is preceded
by faith; it is followed by baptism. The resolution
to do right will naturally lead to baptism, for that
is a part of doing right. Won&rsquo;t you say at the beginning
of this new year, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to resolve now that
from this day henceforth I will live for God&rdquo;? If
that be your resolution, come forward and make it
known while we stand and sing.</p>

<br />AN ERRING CHILD OF GOD</h2>
<p>It is my purpose this morning to discuss the case
of an erring child of God in contrast to that of an
alien sinner. An alien sinner is one who has never
been baptized into Jesus Christ, one who has never
become a member of the Lord&rsquo;s church, one who has
never become a citizen of the kingdom of our Lord
and Saviour, Jesus Christ. The plan of salvation for
such an one is clearly revealed in the Bible. It has
been proclaimed from this pulpit numbers and numbers
of times. It needs to be repeated over and over
again, and to be kept constantly before the minds
of the people.</p>
<p>Not only should those who are not Christians
know the plan of salvation in order to become Christians,
but those who have already obeyed the gospel
ought to know what an alien must do to be saved
well enough to teach others effectively. The alien
must know the gospel well enough to obey it. The
Christian must have a working knowledge of the
gospel in order to help save others.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly teaches that in order to become
a child of God one must believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of the living God; that he must then
repent of his sins (Acts 2:38 and 3:19); that he must
confess with his mouth the faith which he has in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
heart; and finally he must be baptized for remission
of sins (Acts 2:38; 22:16, and many other places
which might be cited). These are the conditions of
salvation for an alien sinner. Obedience to these
commandments makes one a child of the Lord.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">A Word of Encouragement</span></h3>
<p>But suppose one errs from the truth after having
obeyed these commandments. That would make him
an erring child of God. The case of such an one deserves
our consideration. Is there a plan of salvation
for one who errs from the truth after having been
baptized into Christ&mdash;into the family of God? If so,
what are the conditions of his salvation? On this
topic there seems to be some confusion and misunderstanding.
Occasionally we meet someone who
thinks that there is no way for him to be saved, if he
sins after he has been baptized&mdash;that his case is hopeless,
if he turns away from the church after having
once been a member thereof. I would like to speak a
word of encouragement to all such.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one thing which can keep any person
on this earth from being saved, and that is unwillingness
to repent and obey God. I believe it is true that
no matter how far one may have strayed away, if
he wants to come back, if he will repent, and if he
will obey the commandments which God has given,
God is willing to forgive. This is the divine encouragement
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
and inducement which is held out to
all by the word of God (1 John 1:9; 2 Pet. 3:4).</p>
<p>I believe we can say that anyone who has been
a Christian very long has at some time or other been
an erring child of God, for there are none of us who
live perfect lives. I presume there are none here who
even claim to live perfectly. In 1 John 1:8 we
read: &ldquo;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.&rdquo; Everyone, then,
who has been in the church any appreciable length
of time has been, at some time, an erring child of
God. If it were not possible for an erring child of
God to be saved, then none of us would have a
chance, and the whole scheme of redemption would
be vain. Of course, we know that such is not the
case.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">God&rsquo;s Willingness To Forgive</span></h3>
<p>That an erring child of God may be saved is clearly
taught by James 5:19-20, &ldquo;Brethren, if any one of
you do err from the truth and one convert him, let
him know that he which converteth a sinner from
the error of his way, shall save a soul from death
and shall hide a multitude of sins.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a clear-cut
reference unto an erring child of God, for this
statement is addressed unto the brethren. It teaches
that if a brother errs from the straight and narrow
way, there is a chance for him to be restored by another
brother. The one who restores him renders a
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
very valuable service which covers a multitude of
sins and saves a soul from death. That is, he saves a
soul from the lake of fire and brimstone, which is the
second death, for Christians as well as sinners are
appointed unto physical death. Of course, if the
erring brother refuses to obey, he will be lost. He
will be lost because of his unwillingness to obey, and
not because of God&rsquo;s unwillingness to forgive.</p>
<p>We have another reference to erring children of
God in the third chapter of Revelation, in the letter
addressed unto the church at Laodicea. In this
church there were some lukewarm members. Lukewarm
church members are erring children of God.
Of them, Jesus says, &ldquo;I know thy works, that thou
are neither cold nor hot. I would thou wert cold or
hot. So then because thou art lukewarm and neither
cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.&rdquo;
Surely these people were in a bad spiritual condition,
even to the extent of making our Savior sick
at his stomach; but their case was not a hopeless
one. There was still opportunity for them to repent
and to be saved.</p>
<p>This letter itself represents an effort on the part
of God through his Son, Jesus, to lead these people
to repentance, in order that he might forgive them.
He pleads with them as follows: &ldquo;I counsel thee to
buy of me gold tried by the fire; that thou mayest
be rich, and white raiment that thou mayest be
clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do
not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
chasten: be zealous therefore and repent. Behold I
stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my
voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and
will sup with him and he with me. To him that overcometh
will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
even as I also overcame and am set down with my
father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches&rdquo; (Rev.
3:14-22). From this, we not only learn that it is possible
for the erring children to be saved, but that
their salvation is conditioned upon their repentance.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Unwillingness To Repent</span></h3>
<p>The characters mentioned in the first part of the
sixth chapter of Hebrews were lost not because they
were incapable of being saved, but because they were
unwilling to repent. Of them we read, beginning
with verse 4; &ldquo;For it is impossible for those who
were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly
gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
and have tasted the good word of God and the
powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away,
to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they
crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put
him to an open shame.&rdquo; Please note that it does not
say that these people could not be saved; it does not
say that it was impossible for them to repent; but it
says it was impossible to get them to repent, that no
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
one could persuade them to repent, that they persistently
refused to do so.</p>
<p>These were not characters who were still striving
to live the Christian life, but making mistakes along
the way. They were men who had completely turned
their backs upon that which was right. They were
crucifying to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
putting him unto an open shame. And one could
not persuade them to repent. They were not lost because
of God&rsquo;s unwillingness to forgive, but because
of their unwillingness to repent.</p>
<p>It is possible for one to turn so completely away
from the Lord that you cannot get that person to
repent, but please remember that the trouble still
lies with the man himself. Even such an one as that
could be saved if he would repent, but he won&rsquo;t repent.
Whosoever will may come, but there are some
who won&rsquo;t. Jesus says, &ldquo;Ye will not come unto me
that ye may have life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Bible, then, which teaches
that it is impossible for any individual to be saved,
provided he will repent and obey the Lord. There
are simply some who refuse to obey. Anyone can
repent, but there are some who will not. Of such
characters 2 Peter 2:21-22 says: &ldquo;For it had been
better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,
than after they have known it to turn from
the holy commandment delivered unto them. But
it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
the dog is turned to his own vomit again; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the
mire.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Simon the Sorcerer</span></h3>
<p>In the eighth chapter of Acts we have another
example of an erring child of God. His name was
Simon and he was a sorcerer by profession. Of him
verse 13 says, &ldquo;Then Simon himself believed also:
and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip,
and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs
which were done.&rdquo; Jesus said, Mark 16:16: &ldquo;He that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; Simon believed
and was baptized, therefore, Simon was saved.
Simon was a child of God because he had believed
and been baptized. That he was afterwards in error
is plainly taught by Peter in the verses which follow.
Beginning with verse 18: &ldquo;And when Simon saw
that through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands the
Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, saying,
Give me also this power, that on whomsoever
I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But
Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee,
because thou hast thought that the gift of God may
be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part
nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in
the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness,
and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine
heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou
art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to
the Lord for me, that none of these things which
ye have spoken come upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon was a child of God because he had believed
and had been baptized. Afterwards he erred. That
made him an erring child of God. His condition was
serious. He had so sinned as to be aptly described
as being in the bond of iniquity, and in the gall of
bitterness. But his case was not hopeless. Peter&rsquo;s admonition
to him shows clearly that there was still
a chance for him to be saved.</p>
<p>Peter commanded him to repent and to pray. The
commandment to pray for forgiveness implied a
commandment to confess his sins. One cannot consistently
pray for forgiveness until he admits, at least
to himself and to God, that he has sinned. One cannot
even repent until he first admits to himself that
he has done wrong. The commandment to confess
implied by Peter is clearly stated elsewhere in God&rsquo;s
word. For instance, James 5:16: &ldquo;Confess your faults
one to another, and pray one for another that ye
may be healed.&rdquo; Again we read in I John, chapter 1,
verses 9 and 10, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, he is faithful
and just to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not
sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not
in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Scriptures not only teach the possibility of
an erring child of God&rsquo;s being saved, but also the condition
upon which his salvation depends. These conditions
are: repentance of his sins, confession of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
sins, and prayer unto the Lord for forgiveness. Any
erring child of God who conforms to these conditions
will be readily and freely forgiven by our
Father who is in heaven. One who refuses to conform
to these simple conditions assumes full responsibility
for his own destruction. Having put his hand
to the plow, and looking back, he is not fit for the
kingdom of God (Luke 9:62). He must repent or
perish (Luke 13:3).</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Prodigal Son</span></h3>
<p>The story of the prodigal son very beautifully and
accurately illustrates the plan we are discussing. The
prodigal son does not represent an alien sinner. He
was a son. He represents an erring child. He went
away from home contrary to his father&rsquo;s will, and
he wasted his father&rsquo;s goods in riotous living. He
was a wayward child. He was a disobedient son of
his father; and finally, when he had tasted the bitter
dregs of sin, he resolved to go back home.</p>
<p>The Bible says that he came to himself. He
recognized that he had sinned. That was the first
step in his restoration. When he thought about the
good things back in his father&rsquo;s home in contrast
with his own suffering, he recognized that he had
made a mistake. Then he made a resolution. He said,
&ldquo;I will arise and go unto my father.&rdquo; And the very
minute he made up his mind to go to his father, that
was repentance. Repentance is a change of purpose.
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
A determination to quit doing wrong and to begin
doing right. And so when the young man said to
himself, &ldquo;I will go, I will return to my father, and
to my father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; that resolution constituted
repentance. Then the story says that he arose and
came to his father. That was the fruit of his repentance.</p>
<p>He had planned his confession. He said, &ldquo;I will
say unto my father, Father, I have sinned against
heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to
be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired
servants.&rdquo; The young man expected to plead his case
with his father. He didn&rsquo;t even hope to be reinstated
as a son. But he was going to beg that he might be
allowed to come back as a servant. Imagine his surprise
when his father ran to meet him and welcomed
him back into the family circle. The boy started to
make his confession, but before he had had time to
finish, the father interrupted him and said: &ldquo;Bring
forth the best robe and put it on him; and put a
ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring
hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat, and
be merry. For this my son was dead, and is alive
again, he was lost and is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this not only illustrates what an erring child
of God must do to be saved, but it also represents
God&rsquo;s willingness to forgive him. This young man
repented, he reformed, he confessed, and he prayed.
He prayed to his father to take him back into his
home. (He had planned his confession in his heart
even if he were not allowed to express it all.) That
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
is just exactly what an erring child of God must do.
As we learn from Peter, James and John, he must
repent, confess his sins, and pray for forgiveness. Just
as the father of that prodigal son was eager to receive
him back into his home, so our heavenly Father
stands waiting to receive unto the bosom of his love
all of his wayward children who will come back to
him in humility, penitence, confession and prayer.
Just as that father showered his son with blessings,
so Jehovah will shower his wayward children who
return to him with the blessings of forgiveness, protection,
and encouragement.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Church&rsquo;s Duty</span></h3>
<p>In conclusion it might be well to mention the duty
of the church in reference to an erring child of God.
It is the duty of the church and of all its spiritually-minded
members to warn those who are living in
error, to rebuke them, to reprove them and to exhort
them with all long suffering and teaching, to admonish
them to do these three things which are required
of them in order to be forgiven by the Lord. When
we do so, we shall in no wise lose our reward.</p>
<p>I close then by calling attention once more to these
verses in James, &ldquo;Brethren, if anyone of you do err
from the truth, and one convert him; let him know
that he which converteth a sinner from the error of
his way, shall save a soul from death and shall hide a
multitude of sins.&rdquo; Now, there may be some erring
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
children of God in this audience this morning. I
want to do just what the Bible teaches me to do. I
want to admonish you, urge you, and beseech you
to take advantage of God&rsquo;s goodness and God&rsquo;s mercy
and God&rsquo;s willingness to forgive.</p>
<p>The alien sinner must believe, repent, and be baptized.
The erring child of God must repent, confess
his sin, and pray for forgiveness. But I don&rsquo;t care
how black your past may have been, how many ugly
things you may have done, if you will confess to men,
to yourself, and to God that you have sinned; if you
will resolve in your heart that you will turn away
from your evil doing, and ask God to forgive you,
He will certainly do so. He never goes back on His
promise. He&rsquo;s not only willing, but is eager to have
you come. He will welcome you back into the fold
of those who are redeemed.</p>
<p>All of those evil things which you have done will
not only be forgiven, but they will be forgotten.
They will never be remembered any more, and you
can start all over again to live the Christian life, with
a perfectly clean, white record; all the blots having
been wiped away by the all-powerful blood of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. Don&rsquo;t you want to do that?
We urge you to do so, while together we stand and
sing.</p>

<br />THE SABBATH</h2>
<p>Negative sermons are sometimes necessary. It is
the duty of gospel preachers not only to proclaim
the truth but also to condemn error and convict the
gainsayers (Titus 1:9). Wherever false teaching raises
its ugly head, we must strike it down with the sword
of the Spirit. Wherever it lurks in secret hiding
places to destroy unwary souls, we must search for
it and expose it with the light of truth. We must
warn people against it.</p>
<p>Much money and effort are spent to protect people
from contagious diseases. In a public building of
downtown Nashville yesterday I saw above a water
fountain a sign which said, &ldquo;Do not put your mouth
on the faucet unless you wish to catch or spread disease.&rdquo;
Certainly we should labor diligently to prevent
the spreading of <i>religious</i> error. I wish I were able to
place a skull and cross bones sign across every false
doctrine.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Purpose and Occasion</span></h3>
<p>It is my purpose this morning to label and expose
the false doctrine of the Seventh Day Adventists with
respect to the sabbath. In view of the current meeting
at the War Memorial Auditorium, this lesson is
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
certainly timely. I&rsquo;m taking no advantage of those
whose teaching I examine, for my purpose has been
duly advertised in the daily press, and they are invited
to be here. The overflow crowd present this
morning indicates a lively interest in this topic. I
wish I had the opportunity to speak to all of those
who have been listening to error in reference to the
sabbath. I proceed with malice in my heart toward
none.</p>
<p>The zeal and liberality of the Seventh Day Adventists
are admirable. They are spending a lot of money
to teach what they evidently believe to be the truth.
The advertising for their current meeting is costing
thousands of dollars. Their winning several converts
to a doctrine that is not only false but also unpopular
and inconvenient is evidence that advertising is
effective. But their zeal is without knowledge and
their converts have accepted error. The work they
are doing at present constitutes a public challenge
to all preachers of the gospel. That challenge shall
not go unanswered. I make no personal criticism of
their speaker but I condemn his teaching because it
is false.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Three Dispensations</span></h3>
<p>The Bible reveals unto us three distinct dispensations
or periods of time. On the board I have a little
diagram to represent those three dispensations. (See
<a href="#Page_144">p. 144</a>.) The first lasted from Adam to Moses; the
second continued from Moses until the death of
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
Christ on the cross; the third began at the cross and
will continue until our Lord comes again.</p>
<p>During the first period, the family was the unit of
worship. In divers manners and various portions God
communicated with the heads of the families, such
as Adam, Noah, Abram, <i>et al</i>. These men were
known as patriarchs (Heb. 7:4; Acts 2:29; 7:8, 9)
and accordingly this period is known as the patriarchal
dispensation. At Mt. Sinai God gave another
law to the Jewish nation which continued in force
until Christ died on the cross. This law was given
through Moses and applied to the Jews only. Hence
the second period is known as the Mosaic dispensation.
Throughout this period the patriarchal regulations
continued to apply to the Gentile families and
nations but the Jews were governed by the law given
at Sinai. There were two laws in force simultaneously
but applying to different peoples. God never had
two different laws applying to the same people at
the same time.</p>
<p>During the third period, or Christian dispensation,
we have, of course, the will or the law of Christ. In
Hebrews 1:1-2 we read, &ldquo;God, who at sundry times
and in divers manners spake in times past unto the
fathers by the prophets, hath in these days spoken
unto us by his son.&rdquo; That makes a distinct break at
the cross. Before Christ came God spoke unto our
fathers by the prophets in dreams, visions, etc., but
unto us he hath spoken through his Son, Jesus Christ.
In the New Testament we have the will of Christ
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
which went into effect when he died on the cross
(Heb. 9:15-17).</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Adventist Claim</span></h3>
<p>The advocates of the seventh day sabbath make a
very broad claim. They claim that the command to
remember the sabbath day and keep it holy (the
fourth commandment of the Decalogue given at Sinai)
has been binding on all people throughout all
ages and will continue to be in force as long as time
shall last. In other words, they claim that it has been
binding throughout each of the dispensations already
mentioned. With the diagram (<a href="#Page_144">p. 144</a>) to keep these
three periods before our minds, let us examine the
claim in the light of the Bible.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">No Sabbath for Man During First 2,500 Years</span></h3>
<p>First of all, I emphatically deny that God commanded
anyone to keep the sabbath before the children
of Israel were led out of Egypt. According to
the Seventh Day Adventists, the &ldquo;fourth commandment&rdquo;
was in force at least 2,500 years before it was
made known. This could not be. Moses wrote the
book of Genesis. He probably wrote it after the law
was given at Sinai. It covers almost the entire patriarchal
period. <i>In this book the word &ldquo;sabbath&rdquo; is
not found at all!</i> Genesis 2:2 says that God rested
on the seventh day, but it does not say that he told
Adam and Eve to rest; neither does it call the seventh
day the sabbath. &ldquo;And on the seventh day God ended
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
his work which he had made; and he rested on the
seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
because that in it he had rested from all his work
which God created and made.&rdquo; Please note that that
is <i>not a commandment</i>; it is a statement of facts. It
is a statement of the fact that <i>God</i> rested on the seventh
day and a statement of the further fact that (at
some later date) he sanctified and blessed the seventh
day. There is no commandment in that Scripture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the very tense of the verb used in
verse 3 shows that he did not sanctify the day at the
time he rested. Note this tense: &ldquo;because in it he <i>had
rested</i>.&rdquo; It does not say &ldquo;because he was resting&rdquo; but
&ldquo;because he <i>had rested</i>&rdquo; on that day. The very tense
of the verb shows that after God himself had rested
on the seventh day, <i>at some later time</i>, when he could
refer to the fact that he had rested in the past tense,
he sanctified that day. Genesis does not say <i>when</i> he
sanctified it. Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 reveal
that he sanctified it as a day of rest for the Jews in
the wilderness when he gave the law at Mt. Sinai,
after he had led them out of Egypt. The seventh day
was sanctified at the close of the patriarchal dispensation,
<i>at least 2,500 years after the world began</i>.</p>
<p>The mentioning of the sanctification in Genesis
2:3 has been called a case of prolepsis, or joining together
in statement two events that were separated
in time. Other examples of prolepsis may be found
in Genesis 3:20, 4:20, and Matthew 10:4. No one can
show where God sanctified the seventh day, much less
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
where he commanded anyone to keep it, until after
the deliverance of the Jews from Egypt.</p>
<p>The seventh day of the week is first called the
sabbath in Exodus 16, in connection with the giving
of the manna to the Jews in the wilderness. In anticipation
of the law soon to be given at Sinai, God
instructed the people to gather two days&rsquo; supply on
the sixth day and warned them not to expect any
on the seventh day. The manner in which the sabbath
is thus introduced shows that they were not accustomed
to keeping it. In spite of these special instructions,
some went out to gather manna on the
seventh day and found none. This shows their lack
of familiarity with the seventh day sabbath. The sabbath
was a new institution soon to be established.
Here it was first introduced. At Mt. Sinai a few days
later it was made known. &ldquo;Thou camest down also
upon Mt. Sinai, and spakest with them from
heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true
laws, good statutes and commandments; and madest
known unto them thy holy sabbath and commanded
them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of
Moses thy servant ...&rdquo; (Neh. 9:13, 14; see also Ex.
20:8-11, and Deut. 5:12-15). If they were already familiar
with the sabbath, how could God have <i>made
it known</i> to them at Mt. Sinai?</p>
<p>Soon after the sabbath command was given at Sinai,
a Jew went out and picked up sticks on the sabbath
day (Num. 15:32-36). That this ceremonial institution
was new is shown by the fact that Moses put
that man in jail until he could inquire from God
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
what should be done. Don&rsquo;t you know that if God&rsquo;s
people had been keeping the sabbath 2,500 years,
<i>they would have known</i> what to do with a man who
violated it? (Incidentally, God commanded that he
be stoned to death. I have not heard of any modern
Sabbatarians thus punishing the violation of their
favorite law. If the seventh day sabbath were still in
force, <i>the death penalty for violating it would also
still be in force</i>.)</p>
<p>And so, my friends, I boldly declare that there is
no verse of Scripture in the Bible which shows that
any man ever kept the sabbath during the period
from Adam to Moses. In the history that covers this
period of approximately 2,500 years there is no commandment
to keep the sabbath; there is no example
of man&rsquo;s resting on the seventh day; there is no promise
of reward for his doing so; there is no threat of
punishment for his failing to do so. Those who teach
that the seventh day sabbath was in force during this
period are urgently requested to cite the text that
says so. Since they cannot do so, the first pillar in the
foundation of the seventh day sabbath theory is completely
destroyed. <i>It is simply nonexistent.</i></p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Never Applied To the Gentiles</span></h3>
<p>Coming now to the second part of the diagram (<a href="#Page_144">p. 144</a>),
I emphatically deny that there is any place in
the Bible to show that God ever commanded the Gentile
nations to keep the sabbath day, even during the
Mosaic dispensation. Seventh Day Adventists are obligated
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to furnish the text which says that he did so,
but they cannot furnish it. In fact, there are plenty
of Scriptures to show that this ceremonial institution
was not in force among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Speaking of the sabbath, God said, &ldquo;It is a sign
between me and the children of Israel for ever ...&rdquo;
(Ex. 31:17). If the other nations had been observing
the seventh day sabbath also, it could not have been
a sign between God and the Jews. Down in the
country where I was reared each farmer had a certain
mark which he used to distinguish his livestock
in the woods from that of others. For instance, one
fellow split his hogs&rsquo; ears at two places. That was his
mark, but if every other farmer used the same mark,
it would cease to be a sign of the stock which belonged
to that particular man. If every ranchman
in the West used the same brand for his cattle, it
would not be a sign of that which belonged to any
one in particular. <i>Yet the sabbath was a sign between
God and the children of Israel.</i> Therefore, it was peculiar
to that law which applied to them, and was
not a part of any other law given by Jehovah to any
other people or at any other time.</p>
<p>The sabbath was a memorial to an event peculiar
to the Jewish family. &ldquo;And remember that thou wast
a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord
thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty
hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord
thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day&rdquo;
(Deut. 5:15). The Gentiles were never delivered
from Egyptian bondage and, therefore, could not
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
observe the sabbath in memory of any such event.
This Scripture not only proves that the Gentiles were
not commanded to observe the sabbath, but also that
the Jews themselves did not keep it <i>until after</i> they
were delivered from Egypt. If a stranger desired to
become identified with the Jewish nation and religion
he was <i>permitted</i> to do so by submitting to the
Jewish law, including the sabbath regulation (Isa.
56:3-7). In this event he ceased to be a Gentile religiously,
but became a Jew instead. If the sabbath
had been a universal practice, it would not have been
necessary for a proselyte to <i>begin</i> observing it when
he submitted to the Jewish religion. What has been
said proves conclusively that the sabbath was purely
a <i>Jewish</i> institution. I most urgently request that
those who advocate the observance of the Jewish
sabbath show us at least one verse of Scripture in
which God ever commanded the Gentiles to do so.
This they <i>cannot</i> do. Hence, the second pillar essential
to the support of their theory is completely lacking.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Sabbath Commandments Not in The Law of Christ</span></h3>
<p>Coming now to the last section in the diagram (on
<a href="#Page_144">page 144</a>), I emphatically deny that there is any verse
of Scripture which states that God ever commanded
<i>anybody</i> to keep the sabbath day since Jesus died on
the cross. No one can find such a text in the Bible.
I&rsquo;m not unaware of some attempts made along that
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
line by Seventh Day Sabbatarians. For instance, they
refer to Matthew 24:20, where Jesus told his disciples
to pray that, when the city of Jerusalem was destroyed
(in <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 70), they might not have to make
their flight on the sabbath day. But the very same
verse tells them to pray likewise that their flight be
not in the winter. He told them to pray that their
flight be not in the winter because it would be difficult
to travel and find comfortable shelter at that
season. In like manner, they were told to pray that
their flight be not on the sabbath day because the
unconverted Jews would still be observing the sabbath
and in harmony with the commandment given
by Nehemiah (ch. 13, vss. 15-17) would keep the
gates of the city closed throughout the sabbath day.
Under such conditions it would have been almost
impossible for the Christians to have fled from the
city on the sabbath day. It was for that reason that
they were told to pray that their flight be not on the
sabbath. Such instructions on the part of Jesus did
not imply that the Christians would be expected to
<i>rest</i> on the seventh day.</p>
<p>Naturally you can find examples of unconverted
Jews keeping the sabbath day after Jesus died on
the cross. Paul went to their synagogues and preached
to them on Saturday, telling them that they were no
longer obligated to keep the law of Moses. We have
a parallel case in Nashville today. The Seventh Day
Adventists have advertised a religious meeting at the
War Memorial Auditorium tonight. That does not
mean that they recognize Sunday as the sabbath day,
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
for they do not. The apostle Paul went to the synagogue
where the people were on Saturday to preach
to them. That does not mean that he recognized
Saturday as the sabbath day, for he did not.</p>
<p>The sabbath is mentioned sixty times in the New
Testament. Forty-three of these cases are in connection
with the life of Jesus Christ. According to the
flesh, Christ was a Jew. He was born under the law,
&ldquo;to redeem them that were under the law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4, 5).
Before taking the law out of the way (Col. 2:14), he
<i>fulfilled</i> it by <i>obeying</i> it perfectly (Matt. 5:17, 18).
Naturally, he kept the sabbath, just as he kept the
passover and all the other ceremonies of the law of
Moses. All of this occurred before Christ died and,
therefore, before his will, under which we are now
living, went into effect (Heb. 9:15, 17).</p>
<p>In Bible history following the death of Christ, the
sabbath is mentioned seventeen times. In sixteen of
these cases it refers to the worship of the unconverted
Jews. In the other case, the only one found in the
Epistles, it is used to state that <i>Christians are not
expected to observe it</i>. &ldquo;Let no man therefore judge
you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day,
or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days ...&rdquo; (Col.
2:16). Friends, all of this simply confirms and emphasizes
the conclusion that there is absolutely not
one word of Scripture to show that God ever commanded
any Christian to regard the seventh day of
the week as a sabbath day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">VII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Christian&rsquo;s Day of Worship</span></h3>
<p>Christians are taught to worship on the first day
of the week. &ldquo;Now concerning the collection for the
saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia,
even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let
every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath
prospered him, that there be no gathering when I
come&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:1, 2). The last phrase in this quotation
shows that Paul did not refer to merely laying
aside some money at home but rather to putting
money into a common treasury. This definitely implies
that the church was accustomed to meeting on
the first day of the week. The purpose of this weekly
assembling was to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper. They were
rebuked for allowing something to interfere with
this holy purpose (1 Cor. 11:20-26).</p>
<p>The importance of this assembling on the first day
of the week to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper is clearly revealed.
&ldquo;... and let us consider one another to provoke
unto love and good works: not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
more as ye see the day approaching&rdquo; (Heb. 10:24,
25). Under the guidance of the inspired apostle the
church at Troas also met to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper
on the first day of the week. &ldquo;And upon the first day
of the week, when the disciples came together to
break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
on the morrow, and continued his speech until
midnight&rdquo; (Acts 20:7).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Seventh Day Adventists teach that the Catholic
Church changed the sabbath from Saturday to Sunday,
and challenge the public to cite the Scripture
which says that the first day of the week is the sabbath.
<i>There is no such scripture. The first day of the
week is not the sabbath! It is the day on which Christians
ought to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper.</i> It is a day of
<i>worship</i>, not necessarily a day of <i>rest</i>. Neither <i>rest</i>
nor <i>work</i> should be allowed to interfere with a Christian&rsquo;s
<i>worship</i> on the first day of the week. We have
met today to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper by the authority
of the Scriptures cited above and not by the authority
of any church. Christians were eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper
on the first day of the week several hundred
years before the Roman Catholic Church came into
existence. I hereby challenge the Sabbatarians to
furnish even one word of Bible authority for eating
the Lord&rsquo;s supper on Saturday.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Will of Christ</span></h3>
<p>Christians are living under the reign of Christ.
They are expected to obey the word that God hath
spoken unto us by his Son (Heb. 1:2). This word is
called the will, or testament, of Christ. As in the case
of human wills, it became of force when he died on
the cross. &ldquo;For where a testament is, there must also
of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament
is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of
no strength at all while the testator liveth&rdquo; (Heb.
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
6:16, 17). The will of Christ teaches Christians to
worship on the first day of the week, but it does not
teach them to rest on the seventh day. The will of
Christ forbids murder, stealing, lying, and such like
(Rom. 13:9), but it does not forbid working on Saturday.
&ldquo;For the law was given by Moses, but grace
and truth came by Jesus Christ&rdquo; (John 1:17). This
grace teaches righteous living (Titus 2:11, 12), but
it does not teach that Saturday should be observed
as a sabbath.</p>
<p>When the will of Christ was established by his
death on the cross, the law which God had given
to the Jews through Moses at Sinai came to an end.
This the Bible abundantly teaches. &ldquo;He taketh away
the first, that he may establish the second&rdquo; (Heb.
10:9). &ldquo;But we have been discharged from the law,
having died to that wherein we were held; so that
we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness
of the letter&rdquo; (Rom. 7:6 ARV). In 2 Corinthians
3:6-18 we have a contrast between the law given at
Sinai, including the sabbath commandments (see
verse), and the will of Christ. The former was
glorious; the latter much more glorious. The former
was done away; the latter remaineth. &ldquo;For if that
which is done away was glorious, much more that
which remaineth is glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Galatians, chapter 3, speaking of the law God
gave to the Jews at Sinai, 430 years after his covenant
with Abraham, Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore the law
was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that
we might be justified by faith. But after that faith
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster&rdquo; (Gal.
3:24, 25). I ask you if words could be plainer. &ldquo;The
law was our schoolmaster ... we are no longer under
a schoolmaster.&rdquo; Is that sufficient? Do I need to cite
other texts, such as Colossians 2:14-16; Ephesians
2:10-22; Galatians 4:1-31, etc.? No wonder Paul said
in Galatians 5:4, &ldquo;Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are (he who would be&mdash;ARV)
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IX</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>Beloved, you have seen that the commandment
to remember the sabbath day and keep it holy is
confined to the law God gave to the Jews through
Moses in the wilderness. It is not named in the history
of God&rsquo;s people during the 2,500 years prior to
that time. <i>It is peculiar to the law of Moses.</i> It is not
found at any other place in the Bible. It was not in
force during the patriarchal dispensation. Even during
the Mosaic age, or dispensation, it never applied
to the Gentiles. It is not binding during the Christian
dispensation. It has no place in the will of
Christ. The only law in which it is found fulfilled
its purpose, was fulfilled by Christ, and was taken
out of the way when he died on the cross.</p>
<p>The law of Moses could not take away sins; the
will of Christ can (Rom. 1:16). I beseech you by the
mercies of God to believe the will of Christ, obey its
commandments, and enjoy its promises. The will of
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Christ says to believers, &ldquo;Repent, and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). The will of Christ
says, &ldquo;And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be
baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name
of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts 22:16).</p>
<p>The law of Christ teaches us to worship God in
spirit and in truth, by singing, praying, studying,
teaching and by laying by in store and eating the
Lord&rsquo;s supper on the first day of the week. The law
of Christ teaches us to love God with all our heart,
power, soul, mind and strength; to love our neighbors
as ourselves and to do unto others as we would
have them do unto us. The will of Christ promises
the faithful a crown of everlasting life. This is the
perfect law of liberty. It is holy, just and good. It is
complete. It is a glorious law. Its glory outshines that
of all other laws as the sun outshines the stars (2
Cor. 3:10). It furnishes the man of God completely
unto every good work. It is the law of life, rather
than the law of death. It is the law of eternal happiness,
rather than the law of condemnation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you want to hear Christ and obey this new
law enacted upon better promises, glorious in its
origin, glorious in its power and purpose, and glorious
because it leads to a life of eternal glory for
all of those who faithfully follow it? While we stand
and sing we bid you come to Jesus and let him save
you from all your sins.</p>

<br />SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISM REVIEWED</h2>
<p>Those of you who were present last Lord&rsquo;s day
remember that I spoke on the topic &ldquo;The Sabbath.&rdquo;
Since that time I have received several letters from
people who were not able to be present, but who
requested that I send them a copy of the lesson presented.
I&rsquo;m glad to announce that the sermon was
recorded by dictaphone and will be ready for free
distribution soon. I have also received many requests
that I continue today along the same line that
was begun last Lord&rsquo;s day. To these requests I am
conceding. It would be more pleasant to preach without
naming the mistakes of others but, when the
souls of men and women are involved, we cannot
afford to shirk our duty.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Review</span></h3>
<p>The main points in the lesson last Lord&rsquo;s day
were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">1. Bible history is divided into three periods: the
Patriarchal Dispensation; the Mosaic Dispensation;
and the Christian Dispensation.</p>
<p class="revint">2. There was no sabbath during the first period
which lasted from Adam to Moses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p class="revint">3. The sabbath commandment never applied to
the Gentiles&mdash;not even during the Mosaic dispensation.</p>
<p class="revint">4. The sabbath commandment was confined to the
law of Moses which was abolished when Christ
died on the cross.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Christians are not required to rest on Saturday.</p>
<p class="revint">6. Christians are taught to worship on the first day
of the week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the correspondence received since last Lord&rsquo;s
day there is no word of criticism or objection. I take
the silence to mean that those who were present were
convinced that what was said was based on Bible
authority. I am determined that the same shall be
true of what I say today. It is my prayerful purpose
to preach nothing but what is plainly revealed in
the Bible.</p>
<p>The ushers have given you a mimeographed copy
of some of the main points to be discussed in today&rsquo;s
lesson. You may use these papers to make further
notes, especially to take note of the Bible references
used, that you may go home and read them for yourselves
and see that what we say is true. The noble
people of Berea searched the Scriptures daily to see
whether they had heard the truth. If all people would
do that, it would not be so easy for error to gain
acceptance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">&ldquo;The Two Laws&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>In my hand I hold a copy of one of the so-called
Bible lessons distributed by the Seventh Day Adventists.
The title of this pamphlet is &ldquo;The Two
Laws.&rdquo; That title implies that God has never given
but two laws. That is a mistake. God has given different
laws to different people at different times, as
the occasion and his eternal purpose required. His
law to Adam before the fall was different from his
law to Adam after the fall. His law to Cain was not
the same as his law to Noah. His law to Abram was
not identical with his law to the Jews. His law since
Christ died on the cross is quite different from any
law he gave before that time.</p>
<p>God does not change (Mal. 3:6) but <i>he changes his
laws</i> according to his wisdom. &ldquo;For the priesthood
being changed, there is made of necessity a change
also of the law&rdquo; (Heb. 7:12). God has never had two
different laws applying to the same people at the
same time. &ldquo;He taketh away the first that he may
establish the second&rdquo; (Heb. 10:9). The law given
the Jews at Sinai was a unit. It was one law, not two
laws.</p>
<p>In the lesson last Lord&rsquo;s day such Scriptures as
Romans 7:6; Hebrews 6:8-13; Hebrews 10:9; Colossians
2:13-16; and Galatians 3:17, 24, 25 were quoted
to show that the law which God gave to the Jews
through Moses at Mt. Sinai was fulfilled and taken
out of the way when Christ died. The Seventh Day
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
Adventists admit that all of this law was taken out
of the way except Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy
5:6-21. They are thus committed to the fact that
God sometimes changes his laws. When they teach
that God abolished <i>part</i> of that law they admit that
he could have abolished <i>all</i> of it; and that is <i>exactly
what he did</i>. I want you to read those Scriptures and
note that they speak of &ldquo;the law,&rdquo; not a &ldquo;part of
the law.&rdquo; For instance, &ldquo;But now we are delivered
from the law (not &lsquo;part of the law&rsquo;) ...&rdquo; (Rom.
7:6). &ldquo;Wherefore the law (not &lsquo;part of the law&rsquo;) was
our schoolmaster ... but that after faith is come we
are no longer under a schoolmaster&rdquo; (Gal. 3:24-25).</p>
<p>Where is the Scripture that says that a <i>part of that
law</i> was abolished? Every text which teaches that a
part of it was taken away teaches that <i>all</i> of it was
taken away and a new law, the law of Christ, was
given, not to the Jews only but to the whole world.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">&ldquo;Ceremonial&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moral&rdquo; Laws</span></h3>
<p>At this point I want to read to you the leading
sentence in this Adventist pamphlet we are reviewing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The New Testament Scriptures clearly present two different
divisions of the Old Testament laws: the moral law as summed
up in the Ten Commandments, which is binding on Christians
as a rule of life and conduct; the ceremonial law of typical ordinances,
which was abolished at the cross and from which Christians
are entirely free.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want you to carefully note what that quotation
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
says. It says that the New Testament Scriptures
<i>clearly present</i> two laws in the Old Testament&mdash;the
&ldquo;moral law&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ceremonial law.&rdquo; Now I want
to ask you a simple question. How in this world
could the New Testament Scriptures clearly present
something that is not even mentioned anywhere in
the Bible? Friends, think of it! &ldquo;Moral&rdquo; law and
&ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo; law are not mentioned in your Bible.
That is not Bible language. In order to prove the
sabbath theory by the Bible it will be necessary to
find each of these four texts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">1. The text which says that the &ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo; law
was abolished.</p>
<p class="revint">2. The text which says that the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; law is
still binding.</p>
<p class="revint">3. The text which says that Exodus 20:2-17 and
Deuteronomy 5:6-21 are the &ldquo;moral law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint">4. The text which says that the rest of the law
given through Moses is the &ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo; law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can such texts be found when you may search
your Bible from the first word in Genesis to the last
word in Revelation and you will find neither the
word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; nor the word &ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo;? Those
words are not in the Bible. I challenge the Sabbatarians
to find either of them.</p>
<p>Even if the first two texts named above could be
found, the Adventist theory would not be established
unless the last two could also be found. In fact, it
would be destroyed, for in the very nature of the case
the sabbath commandment is a ceremonial one.
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
There is nothing moral about it. According to <i>Webster</i>
(the <i>Bible</i> doesn&rsquo;t mention the word) a <i>moral</i>
commandment is one that&rsquo;s based on common sense
and on our natural knowledge of what rules should
guide us in our relationships one to another. The
sabbath commandment does not come in this class.
There&rsquo;s nothing moral about one day in the week
any more than another. Nothing could distinguish
one day from another, except a positive decree from
God Almighty. In that case it would be ceremonial.
If you were to sleep for an indefinite period, upon
awaking you wouldn&rsquo;t know the day of the week.
You couldn&rsquo;t tell Saturday from any other day to
save your life. As far as our natural senses go, one
day is just like another. There is no authority, Biblical
or otherwise, for calling Exodus 20:2-17 and
Deuteronomy 5:6-21 the &ldquo;moral law&rdquo; and the rest
of the Mosaic code the &ldquo;ceremonial law.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Sinaitic Law a Unit</span></h3>
<p>The Bible speaks of the law which God gave to
the Jews in the wilderness in the singular, as one law,
not two laws. Such expressions as &ldquo;the book of the
law of Moses,&rdquo; &ldquo;the law,&rdquo; &ldquo;the book of the law,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the law of God&rdquo; are used interchangeably in the
Bible to designate all of the Jewish law (See Nehemiah
8:1, 2, 3, 8). They are never used to distinguish
one part of it from another part. &ldquo;The law of Moses&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the law of the Lord&rdquo; are used interchangeably
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
in Luke 2:21-24. All of it is called &ldquo;the law of God&rdquo;
because God was the author of all of it. It is called
&ldquo;the law of Moses&rdquo; because it was all given through
Moses as a mediator (Gal. 3:19; John 1:17; Deut.
5:5). It was all written by Moses (Exod. 31:24-27).
Exodus 20:2-17 was originally written by the finger
of God on tables of stone but those tables were destroyed
(Exod. 32:19) and it was written the second
time by Moses himself (Exod. 34:27, 28). The only
thing we know about that law today is what Moses
wrote in the first five books of the Bible. It was all
given at the same time, through the same mediator,
to the same people, by the same authority, for the
same purpose, and was all taken &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo;
at the cross (Col. 2:14-16).</p>
<p>In an effort to make it appear that God gave two
laws (one &ldquo;ceremonial,&rdquo; the other &ldquo;moral,&rdquo; one
eternal and the other temporal) to the Jews at Sinai,
this pamphlet has arranged, in parallel columns.
Scriptures that apparently do not apply to the same
law. This is well designed to confuse or mislead the
untaught; but, in fact, it proves absolutely nothing.
The Bible speaks of many other laws in addition to
the one God gave to the Jews in the wilderness. For
instance, &ldquo;the law of Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 6:2); &ldquo;the law of
the Medes and Persians&rdquo; (Dan. 6:8); &ldquo;the law of my
mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;the law of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 7:23); &ldquo;the law of
works&rdquo;; &ldquo;the law of faith&rdquo; (Rom. 3:27); &ldquo;the law of
liberty&rdquo; (Jas. 2:12); &ldquo;the royal law&rdquo; (Jas. 2:8); etc.,
etc. In addition to all this, there are the laws or
commandments that God gave to Adam, Cain, Noah,
Abraham, et al.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>With the Bible speaking of so many different
laws, it is not surprising that you can find references
that apparently do not apply to the same law. It
would be surprising if you couldn&rsquo;t. In order to harmonize
such texts it certainly is not necessary to apply
them to two imaginary laws that are not even
named in the word of God. The law of faith was
<i>established</i> at the cross; the law God gave to the
Jews was <i>abolished</i> at the cross (Eph. 2:10-22). The
law of Christ is written on the hearts of Christians;
the law of Moses was written, in part, on tablets of
stone (Heb. 8:8-11). The author of the pamphlet
places three references from Romans, chapter 7, in
his &ldquo;moral&rdquo; column. Even if he were correct in doing
this, his theory would still be ruined, for verse 6
of that same chapter says, &ldquo;But now we have been
discharged from the law ...&rdquo; (ARV).</p>
<p>Some of the references placed in opposing columns
by the author really apply to the same law, and present
no conflict whatsoever. For instance, the law
which God gave the Jews at Sinai was both <i>established</i>
and <i>abolished</i>. It was first established and then
abolished. It could not have been abolished if it had
not first been established. It was established by the
life of Christ; it was abolished by the death of Christ.
Christ came not to destroy <i>the law</i> or <i>the prophets</i>
but to fulfill (Matt. 5:17, 18). Jesus said &ldquo;... all
things must be fulfilled, which were written in the
law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
concerning me&rdquo; (Luke 24:44). Christ fulfilled every
prophecy concerning the Messiah in the law and
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
obeyed every commandment in the law. In that sense
he established the law, and after having done so, he
abolished it when he died upon the cross. Salvation
through faith and obedience to Christ is in fulfillment
of the prophecies found in the law of Moses.
In that sense the law of faith establishes the law given
to the Jews at Sinai and abolished by Christ when
he was crucified (Col. 2:14-16).</p>
<p>Not a single text listed by the author in his parallel
columns serves to establish the distinction for which
he contends. If this is the best he can do in that
respect, it only serves to advertise the weakness of
his contention. Every text he cites refers either to the
law God gave the Jews at Sinai and abolished at the
cross, or to the law God gave to the world through
Christ and which went into force when he died at
Calvary. When this is so clearly the case, isn&rsquo;t it
strange that a preacher would try to make it appear
that these Scriptures apply to two imaginary laws
that are not even named in these texts or at any other
place in the Bible?</p>
<p>Since the law given at Sinai was a unit, every Scripture
which teaches that it was taken away at the
cross, indeed teaches that it was taken away as a
whole, in its entirety. Please listen again then to
Ephesians 2:11-18: &ldquo;Wherefore remember, that ye
being in time past Gentiles in the flesh ... ye were
without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel ... but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
were far off are made nigh by the blood of
Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
[Jew and Gentile] one, and hath broken down the
middle wall of partition between us; having abolished
in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
contained in ordinances; for to make in
himself of twain [Jew and Gentile] one new man,
so making peace; and that he might reconcile both
[Jew and Gentile] unto God in one body by the
cross, having slain the enmity thereby ... for through
him we both [Jew and Gentile] have access by one
Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire law of Moses, and <i>especially the sabbath
commandment</i> (Ex. 31:16, 17), was the middle
wall of partition between the Jews and Gentiles.
The Holy Spirit says in the text just quoted that it
was <i>broken down</i>, <i>abolished</i>, at the cross. This text
is a sample of the many additional texts that could
be cited to show that the entire Sinaitic law was
taken out of the way at the cross, but even one is
enough to convince all who love the truth. In Colossians
3:13-16 the Holy Spirit clearly teaches that this
law has been taken out of the way, and that, <i>therefore</i>,
the Jews themselves are no longer required to
keep the sabbaths of the Old Testament. Since the
middle wall of partition has been broken down, there
is neither Jew nor Gentile in Christ, but all are one&mdash;Christian.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Law of Christ</span></h3>
<p>The fact that the law of Moses in its entirety, including
even the Ten Commandments, has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
taken out of the way does not mean that Christians
are without restraint, guidance and law. God hath
&ldquo;spoken unto us by his son&rdquo; (Heb. 1:1-2). This
word that God hath spoken unto us through Christ
is called &ldquo;the law of Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 6:2) or the testament
of Christ (Heb. 9:13-17). It is the law of love
(Rom. 13:8-10). The law of Christ, which has been
applicable to all the world since his death, contains
several commandments that were never included in
any other law given to man. For instance, the commandment
to be baptized for remission of sins (Acts
2:38); the commandment to lay by in store on the
first day of the week (1 Cor. 16:1, 2); and the commandment
to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (1 Cor. 11:23-26;
Acts 20:7).</p>
<p>The law of Moses forbade murder; the law of
Christ forbids not only murder but even needless
anger (Matt. 5:21-22). The law of Moses forbade
adultery; the law of Christ forbids looking upon a
woman to lust after her (Matt. 5:27, 28). The law
of Moses forbade false swearing; the law of Christ
forbids all swearing (Matt. 5:33-37). It was wrong
for the Jews to work on Saturday, for the law of
Moses forbade it (Deut. 5:12-15; Exod. 20:8-11). It
is not wrong for a Christian to work on Saturday,
for the law of Christ does not forbid it (Col. 2:16).
The law of Moses did not require the Jews to engage
in special worship on the first day of the week;
the law of Christ <i>does require</i> Christians to do so
(1 Cor. 16:1-2; 11:17-30; Acts 20:7; Heb. 10:24, 25). It
is wrong for Christians to steal, kill, covet, etc., not
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
because Moses said so, but because the law of Christ
says so (Rom. 3:8-10).</p>
<p>There was a time to hear Moses but that time
has passed. On the mountain of transfiguration,
a cloud overshadowed Moses and the voice of God
said concerning Jesus, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; HEAR YE HIM&rdquo;
(Matt. 17:5). Christians should obey Christ, not
Moses. &ldquo;For the law was given by Moses, but grace
and truth came by Jesus Christ&rdquo; (John 1:17). &ldquo;For
the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world&rdquo; (Titus
2:11, 12).</p>
<p>Friends, would you believe me if I were to tell
you that the Seventh Day Adventists deny the existence
of the word spoken through Christ? Well, just
let me read it to you from the last section of the
pamphlet under review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The abolition of the Ten Commandments would nullify the
gospel of Christ, and render both grace and the atonement void.
&lsquo;Sin is not imputed when there is no law&rsquo; (Romans 5:13). Since
&lsquo;where no law is, there is no transgression&rsquo; (Romans 4:15), it
follows that if the law [meaning the ten commandments] were
abolished, there would be no transgression, and hence no need
of a Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the author meant to say that, but he
said it. According to that, the &ldquo;ten commandments&rdquo;
are the <i>only</i> commandments now in force. That quotation
plainly says that if the &ldquo;ten commandments&rdquo;
are not now in force there are no commandments
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
to disobey, no chance to sin, and no need of a Saviour.
The author has flatly denied every commandment
in the gospel. According to him, Christ gave
no commandments and it is folly to talk about <i>obeying</i>
the gospel (See 2 Thess. 1:8). If the author was
aware of what he was saying, he has deliberately denied
the word of Christ. If he said it inadvertently,
it simply illustrates the absurdities and inconsistencies
into which one falls when he undertakes to teach
error.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Summary</span></h3>
<p>Summarizing what was said last Lord&rsquo;s day and
what has been said today, I am earnestly requesting
the Seventh Day Adventists to furnish the following
Bible texts which are essential to the support of their
theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="revint">1. The text that commanded any one to keep the
sabbath during the period from Adam to Moses.</p>
<p class="revint">2. The text that commanded the Gentile nations
to observe Saturday as a day of rest, even during
the Mosaic dispensation.</p>
<p class="revint">3. The text in the new covenant, or will of Christ,
that commands Christians to rest on Saturday.</p>
<p class="revint">4. The text which says that any one ever ate the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper on Saturday.</p>
<p class="revint">5. The text that even mentions either &ldquo;moral law&rdquo;
or &ldquo;ceremonial law.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the papers furnished you by the ushers you have
a copy of this request for Scriptures. Just to show
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
you how earnest I am about this matter, I&rsquo;m offering
a reward of $100 to the finder of either of these texts.
This offer is backed by my personal integrity and sufficient
resources. I&rsquo;m not making it to be dramatic,
but to impress you with the fact that no such Scriptures
are in the Bible. And yet, friends, these Scriptures
are absolutely essential to the support of the
sabbath theory. Without these texts, that theory has
absolutely not one leg on which to stand. The absence
of these Scriptures leaves that theory without
any support whatsoever.</p>
<p>As further evidence of my sincerity, I want to
make you a proposition. If there is anybody in this
audience who believes he knows now where to find
one of these texts, I&rsquo;m giving you a chance to let it
be known. I&rsquo;ll turn to the reference you give, read
the text you cite, and see whether it meets the demand.
We will not have you arrested for disturbing
public worship, or undertake to embarrass you in
any way. If you will just raise your hand and let me
know where you are, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to stand
up and cite your Scripture. If any one here even
thinks he knows where to find one of these texts, we
are giving you permission to speak up now. (Pause.
No response.) Well, even if you can&rsquo;t find it now,
maybe you believe you can when you get home. If so,
just write to me. My address is on the paper you
have. You may write to me in care of the Chapel
Avenue Church of Christ, Nashville 6, Tenn. If you
want to collect $500, just let me know where those
five texts are. I&rsquo;m simply saying this, friends, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
emphasize that the very texts essential to the sabbath
theory are not in the Bible. Until the Lord gives us
a new Bible, there is no danger of my having to put
out any money on this offer.</p>
<p>Beloved, in closing I beseech you to hear Christ
and obey his gospel. On the condition that you believe,
repent, and be baptized, he promises you pardon.
On the condition that you remain faithful to
the end, he promises you everlasting life. His gospel
has facts to be believed, commandments to be obeyed
and promises to be enjoyed. While we stand and
sing, we are urging you to come to him and let him
save you.</p>

<br />LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>The word of God furnishes us completely unto
every good work. But as we learned this morning,
many of His instructions are left in general form and
must be applied according to our best
judgment.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
For this reason, God endowed us with intelligence,
and admonished us to pray for further wisdom that
we might be able to serve Him in decency and in
order.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Wisdom in the Lord&rsquo;s Plan</span></h3>
<p>We should not be disturbed by the fact that there
are certain decisions which we have to make according
to our own best judgment. I believe there is a
very good reason why God made this arrangement.
Simply because the detailed instructions that would
fit one place might not be suitable at another. For
instance, you had to decide how big to make this
house in which you worship. Suppose God had specified
that a house of worship should be 50 &times; 40 feet.
That might be a suitable building for one community,
but out of order in another.</p>
<p>Since circumstances are so widely different in different
places it was an act of wisdom on the part of
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
God to give us only the general principles that should
govern certain activities and to leave each community
to use its own intelligence in applying these
general principles in a sensible, expedient and practical
way. But it does impose upon us a responsibility
of using some intelligence, of making some wise decisions,
and of giving some thought and consideration
unto our plans.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Responsibilities of Leadership in the Local Church</span></h3>
<p>1. <i>Autonomy of the local church.</i> As some of you
know, I was requested last fall to teach a series of
lessons at Grace Avenue on the subject of church
leadership. When I contemplated the task I wondered
what I would say, but before it was over I
was wondering how I would find time to say what
was to be said. Of course, church leadership means
leadership in the local congregation because that is
the only capacity in which the church can scripturally
function.</p>
<p>Congregational autonomy needs to be emphasized.
God has ordained that each congregation shall be
entirely independent to manage its own affairs under
him without any interference or dictation from any
other congregation or from any other group of people
upon the earth. Since God has ordained that each
congregation shall be independent, we cannot function
in the capacity of a group of congregations organized
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>No inter-congregational organization can scripturally
exist. Therefore, there can be no inter-congregational
ownership of property. We cannot own
property as a whole, that is, as a group of congregations.
You could not deed a piece of property to the
church of Christ in general. It has to be deeded to
a particular congregation. That&rsquo;s the only way the
church can scripturally function. Therefore, when
we speak about leadership in the church, we are
speaking of the leadership in the local congregation.</p>
<p>2. <i>Distribution of work.</i> Now I realize that in the
church there is not such a clear cut division of labor
or responsibility as there is in a business organization
because in the church every member is vitally interested
in every phase of the work. To use an illustration:
I taught temporarily at Peabody last
spring in the mathematics department. Except for a
very general interest in the welfare of the school and
my fellowman, it made no difference to me what the
history teacher next door did or said. I had no responsibility
in reference to his work. There was a
clear cut division between his department and mine.
In the church our relationship to each other is too
intimate and our interest in the general welfare too
great for such a clear cut division of responsibility
to exist.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of efficiency there should be
some distribution of responsibility or work, for the
very simple reason that what is everybody&rsquo;s business
tends to become nobody&rsquo;s business. <i>Unless there is
some mutual agreement as to who shall do what,</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
<i>there is a danger that a great many necessary tasks
will be neglected.</i> Some congregations that are large
have a distribution of responsibility among the elders
themselves. Instead of bringing up every little detail
before a general business meeting, certain ones are
delegated to look after certain phases of the work
and to make all minor decisions regarding the same.</p>
<p>For instance, I know a congregation which has a
maintenance committee, authorized by the overseers,
to keep the building in repair up to the point of
spending so many dollars each month. There&rsquo;s a
limit placed upon what they can spend. They don&rsquo;t
have to get expressions from all the elders before
they replace a broken window light, or make other
minor repairs. This responsibility and authority has
already been scripturally and officially delegated to
them. That illustrates what we mean, then, by division
of responsibility&mdash;a location of responsibility
and a distribution of the tasks that are to be performed.</p>
<p>3. <i>Responsibility of making thoughtful decisions.</i>
As we proceed I cannot quote a lot of Scripture tonight,
for the mere reason that I&rsquo;m talking about
the sphere in which God has not given specific instructions.
That&rsquo;s where the leadership of the church
comes in. In this sphere the overseers of the church
have a great responsibility. Oh, I could spend two
or three hours reciting Scriptures and discussing the
qualifications and work of elders. But it&rsquo;s not our
purpose to discuss that field at this time. We are discussing
the sphere, mentioned in the lesson this
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
morning, where God has given only general
instructions.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
Why, friends, where God has given <i>specific</i> instructions
the overseers don&rsquo;t have to make any decisions.
They simply follow the directions given. It&rsquo;s just
exactly in the realm where specific instructions have
not been given that the overseers are called upon to
make decisions of their own. Where God has specified,
they have very little responsibility. They have
no responsibility in making decisions for God has
already made the decisions.</p>
<p>But there are a thousand questions that God has
not answered specifically. Just to mention a few, He
doesn&rsquo;t tell us what kind of song books to use. He
didn&rsquo;t tell you how big to make this house, or how
many windows to put in each wall. He doesn&rsquo;t tell
you how many meetings to have each week. He
doesn&rsquo;t tell you how often you should have a protracted
meeting, or how many classes to have on
Lord&rsquo;s day morning, or how you should arrange your
missionary program, how many preachers you should
employ and what part of each one&rsquo;s support you
should furnish. A hundred other questions could be
mentioned, which God has not specifically answered.
And, therefore, the elders, the overseers, in every congregation,
must make decisions for themselves in
reference to these things.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m going to tell you the
answer to these questions, for if I were to do so,
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
then I would be making specifications where God has
made none, and, therefore, going beyond that which
is written. But the one thing I do want to do tonight
is to insist that a great deal of thought and study be
given to all such matters and that instead of making
decisions on them recklessly or thoughtlessly or without
proper meditation and study, the very opposite
should be the case.</p>
<p>All such questions, even though they may appear
to be insignificant in their nature, should be weighed
very carefully. For, if there is any field of work in
all this world in which we want to do our very best,
it is in the work of the Lord; and be it ever so good
in the past, we want to make it better in the future;
for God expects us to grow in His work, and to become
better and better as the days go by. So the one
point that I&rsquo;m emphasizing most of all is that in <i>all
these decisions a great deal of study, thought, and
prayer should be used</i>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have been surprised at how carelessly
decisions were made in certain business meetings of
churches where I have labored. I have seen important
decisions determined by a very slight suggestion
from some individual member of the group and
passed immediately, without any time being taken
to carefully study the issues involved. I believe that
what a church business meeting will do is about the
most unpredictable thing in the world. Some of their
decisions are made with such little study and with
such little thought that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to
know what may happen when such a meeting is
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
called. Now I believe that God expects us to use
wisdom in this field where He has left us to our own
judgment. There are Scriptures which authorize this
statement. Some of them were used this morning. For
instance, &ldquo;Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless
as doves&rdquo; (Matt. 10:16). Or again, &ldquo;Let all things
be done decently and in order&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:40).</p>
<p>4. <i>Importance of careful planning.</i> Every outstanding
business organization in this country has its
post-war plans already worked out. It has its blueprints
drawn, and those plans have not been made
hastily. They have been worked out after a great
deal of research, investigation and study. The directors
of those businesses have come together and have
consulted with each other. They have exchanged
ideas. They have weighed details. And after all of
that study and work, they have mapped out their
plans for the years ahead.</p>
<p>Many of these business men are members of the
church, and I maintain that, if men who are able
to succeed in the commercial and professional world
will apply the same diligent study and careful planning
to the work of the church, then it will succeed
far more than it has in the past. There is no other
organization in all this world which would have survived
as much mismanagement or neglect as the
church of Jesus Christ has survived. Someone has
said that the church is certainly a divine institution
or it would have perished from the earth long ago
through neglect or bad management. I have confidence
in the leaders of the churches. I have confidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
in their ability. I believe that they are interested.
If they will give to the work of the church the
same careful study which they devote to the plans
for their business enterprises, I believe we will be
able to make greater progress.</p>
<p>Just to give you an illustration close at hand, everyone
will agree that the effectiveness of our Thursday
evening services has been very greatly increased by
a group of men coming together and carefully planning
the programs. If the attendance is to be taken
as indication of what you think about them, then
they have been improved at least one hundred per
cent. The attendance is now twice as much as it
was before. I am of the firm conviction that what
has been done for the Thursday evening meeting can
be done for every other phase of the work of the
church if it is properly studied and planned.</p>
<p>In some of my connections outside the church I
have been greatly impressed with the conscientiousness
with which certain people go about their work.
The head of a department out at Peabody, who is
engaged in educational work, which certainly isn&rsquo;t
one tenth as important as the work of the church,
studies every little detail. He takes into consideration
all the facts that are at his disposal. He is continually
revising his program and endeavoring to improve
his methods. He listens to every report that he receives.
He will call a conference of those who are
working under him and discuss ways and means of
making his work more effective.</p>
<p>Now, if educational work deserves such careful
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
study as that, surely the work of the church deserves
even more. And yet, friends, I know congregations&mdash;great,
big congregations&mdash;that never do have any sort
of a business meeting. Just think of it! They don&rsquo;t
even have a business meeting! The overseers never
get together to ponder the problems which confront
the local congregation, or to study ways and means
of improving their work.</p>
<p>Now, please remember that the fact that the Bible
furnishes us completely unto every good work does
not relieve us of the responsibility which I am emphasizing.
Anyone who stops to study the matter will
realize that this is true, because there are so many
questions which the Bible does not answer specifically.
We must study and give diligence and pray for
wisdom and use whatever talent the Lord has given
us to make His work just as successful as possible.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Difference in Success and Failure</span></h3>
<p>It needs to be emphasized that the difference between
success and failure very often consists not of
any one great big item but of a great many details
or small factors working together. Not one big thing
but many little things working together very often
makes the difference between success and failure&mdash;in
every phase of life except the church. In the church
they make the difference between outstanding success
and just mediocre success. It is very difficult for
the church to fail completely. As long as it follows
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
the Bible there can be no failure, but those <i>little</i>
things frequently make up the difference between
outstanding success and merely mediocre success, between
doing something that&rsquo;s really worthwhile, outstanding
and unusual, and just drifting and dragging
along.</p>
<p>1. <i>Running a store.</i> I want to try to make this
point clear by use of an illustration. There are some
of you here who are in the mercantile business. You
know lots more about running stores than I do. I
believe you will agree that very often the difference
between success and failure there consists of many
little items working together&mdash;the manner in which
you display your goods on the shelves, the spirit with
which you meet your customers when they come into
your place of business, the courtesy with which you
render service to your patrons, and just a lot of these
little things make up the difference.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make a lot of money on any one item,
but making a small profit on each of a great many
items is what finally spells success. If you will consider
the men who have made fortunes in this world,
I believe you will find that they did not get rich by
making a whole lot of money on one item or unit
of business, but by making a little money on each of
a great many items. The difference between success
and failure then is not always one big thing, but frequently
many little things working together. You
can never fill a barrel by pouring water into the
bunghole while it is running out a thousand nail
holes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>2. <i>Keeping house.</i> The same thing applies to house
work. I don&rsquo;t know much about housekeeping, but
I&rsquo;ve had a chance to observe quite a bit of it as I&rsquo;ve
gone around over the country. And I try to determine
the difference between a good housekeeper and
just an ordinary housekeeper. I&rsquo;m convinced that it
consists not of one big factor but of a great many
details&mdash;the arrangement of this little piece of furniture,
having the magazines up off the floor, a definite
place to keep each of numerous little articles, the
spider webs out of that corner, and many other little
things. I don&rsquo;t know what all of them are, but some
of you ladies do, and I&rsquo;m sure you get the point.</p>
<p>3. <i>Leading singing.</i> The same thing is true in
church work. I remember sitting and listening to a
song director who is very outstanding and who has
won national recognition for his ability to direct congregational
singing. I tried to determine what made
him so successful. I concluded that it was no one
big factor, but a lot of little details about the way
he directed the service; and I&rsquo;m sure that Brother
Murphy, who is helping us on Thursday nights, will
verify this statement.</p>
<p>4. <i>Selecting building site.</i> Let us consider other
details of church work. Any one of them by itself
is not so terribly important, and I&rsquo;m sure that I could
find someone who would argue with me about any
one of them, and say, &ldquo;Oh, well, after all that doesn&rsquo;t
matter,&rdquo; but when you take all of them together it
does matter. It makes the difference between outstanding
success and mere existence. Take for instance
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
the location of the church building. In many
instances very poor judgment has been used in selecting
building sites.</p>
<p>A certain North Carolina town is still a missionary
point, even though there has been a church in it for
at least 25 years. The church building is located on
a dirty back street. There isn&rsquo;t a store in the community.
No business man would have located one there!
Neither is there a school building in the community.
No board of education in the world would have put
one there. After 25 years in such a location the
church is still very small and weak. Very recently they
finally decided, after a painful division, to move up
town.</p>
<p>I shall not exaggerate in describing their building.
The walls were painted, but the overhead was not.
There was no rug, no paint, no carpet of any kind
on the floor. The benches were such as you cannot
find in any country schoolhouse in Davidson County.
They were such as you might have found seventy or
seventy-five years ago. Hanging on the wall just inside
the door there was a mop which was used to clean
the floor and over the pulpit a bottle opener with
which they unfastened the grape juice each Sunday
morning. Over on this side of the building there was
a country-store stove with a pipe running all the way
across the building and into the wall on the other
side. There was a baptistry but no dressing rooms.
The people had to come down the aisle to a hole in
the floor to be baptized and go up the aisle and to
some neighbor&rsquo;s house to change their clothes. Well,
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
now, are you surprised that this church hasn&rsquo;t grown?</p>
<p>Down at Kannapolis where I went to hold a meeting,
they had a church building on a side street to a
side street that got so muddy during the wintertime
that they had to discontinue some of their meetings.
Every time Brother Flannery was called upon to tell
someone how to find the building he would hang
his head. I noticed him one night during our tent
meeting; he started to announce the location of the
building and unconsciously his head went down.
He was ashamed of it. And there would be little
hope for the work at Kannapolis if they had not decided
to remedy that situation. But they&rsquo;ve already
bought two nice lots downtown on which we held
the tent meeting and where they will locate a church
building as soon as possible.</p>
<p>5. <i>Keeping the building in proper condition.</i>
Along with the <i>location</i> of the building is the <i>condition</i>
of the building. Literally, I have preached in
church buildings where the temperature was about
60&deg; or 55&deg; when the service began and 85&deg; when it
closed. People would have on their overcoats when
I started to preach and want to pull off their shirts
before it was over! Well, you may say that that
doesn&rsquo;t make any difference; but you take one hundred
little things like that and it does make a great
deal of difference.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the program may look like a
small item, but it&rsquo;s one of those little items, which,
taken along with others, makes a big difference. Reports
and records of the treasurer and of other workers
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
in the church are important. Our attitude toward
strangers when they visit our meetings is significant.
That&rsquo;s one respect in which the Chapel Avenue congregation
is outstanding. Your courtesy to strangers
has caused much favorable comment.</p>
<p>6. <i>Advertising the work of the church.</i> I&rsquo;ve known
churches to spend three or four hundred dollars to
get a preacher, and refuse to spend $25 to get the
people there to hear him. Think about that! You
know the preacher can&rsquo;t do any good unless the
people are there. I went to a certain city in West
Virginia to hold a meeting, and I wrote to them in
advance urging them to advertise the meeting. Well,
I couldn&rsquo;t say too much, you know. They&rsquo;d think I
was trying to get them to advertise me. After I arrived
I asked them if they&rsquo;d advertised the meeting.
They said, &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; I looked around for a sign but
I didn&rsquo;t see one. The church building was located
on a through highway that ran from the North to
the South. A streamer across the road would have
attracted the attention of everybody who passed.
They hadn&rsquo;t put one up. I looked in the store windows
and saw no ads. I saw none anywhere.</p>
<p>I decided to find out whether they had advertised
the meeting. It was a small town where everybody
is supposed to know what everybody else is doing
anyway&mdash;only about 1,000 people. I went to the stores
and inquired whether a meeting was going on in
town. In every store I entered I was thoroughly informed
about a Nazarene meeting. One fellow got
so enthusiastic that he took me out on the street and
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
showed me the preacher&rsquo;s house and told me where
they were holding the meeting. After they would
finish their story I&rsquo;d always ask if there were any
other meetings going on in town. In each case the
answer was, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our meeting that night I related my experiment
and its results. And I said, &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t think I told
those people any better. I thought I&rsquo;d help you keep
the secret!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the principle on which a great
many churches work.</p>
<p>Remember that you have not advertised the work
of the church when you merely let people know it&rsquo;s
going on. You haven&rsquo;t advertised it until you <i>make
them want a part in it</i>! Everybody in this country
knows that the Standard Oil Company has gasoline
for sale. If that were the end of advertising, they
could discontinue theirs. But that&rsquo;s not the purpose
of it. Their purpose is to make people <i>want</i> Standard
gasoline, so they keep on advertising. Too often we
think we&rsquo;ve advertised the church just because people
know it&rsquo;s in existence, but we have not advertised
it until we make them want a part in it.</p>
<p>7. <i>Handling the finances.</i> Another little detail
that needs careful consideration is the planning of
the financial program of the church. There is one
important respect in which the finance of the church
is different from that of any other organization. I&rsquo;m
not a business man, but I know, nevertheless, that
it&rsquo;s well for a business concern to keep a good surplus
on hand. The bigger margin they can keep between
their income and their outgo, the better off
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
they are. Consequently the administrators of such
businesses endeavor to build up a big bank account;
but friends, that&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen
to a congregation! You cannot get a group of people
to give into a treasury that has several thousand dollars
in the bank. You cannot get people to give to a
church when they know it is not needed.</p>
<p>I got a big surprise a few years ago when I preached
in a certain town on the subject of giving. After I&rsquo;d
finished the members began coming to me and saying,
&ldquo;Why there&rsquo;s no need of telling us about that.
We have several thousand dollars in the bank. Why
should we give? This congregation doesn&rsquo;t need any
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently I held a meeting for another church
which had $10,000 in the bank. I didn&rsquo;t know it, so
I preached on giving and got the same reaction. During
the rest of that meeting I preached on <i>spending</i>!
Before the meeting closed the congregation had plans
to start a new congregation in the north end of town.
Since I left they have bought a building for $4,500,
paid cash for it, and started a new congregation with
about fifty or sixty members. They were going to
wait until the war was over. I wonder what they
would have done in case of the Hundred Years War!
That question occurs to me when people talk about
postponing church work until after the war is over.
We cannot afford to let the Lord&rsquo;s work wait until
the world quits fighting!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential in reference to the financial program
of the church that plans for Scriptural spending be
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
kept right up with, or a little ahead of, the income;
because the income is flexible. When the congregation
sees an increased need and a growing program,
then the contributions will be increased accordingly.
I don&rsquo;t blame people for not giving to a treasury
that&rsquo;s already overflowing. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to contribute
to a church whose leaders would not spend
the money that was contributed. I&rsquo;d find some other
avenue through which to contribute. When it is necessary
to set aside a fund for a new building, or some
other major, anticipated expense, the money should
be earmarked and not counted as part of the operating
account. The financial program of the church is
one of many problems that needs to be given some
careful study.</p>
<p>8. <i>Avoiding disappointment.</i> I want to give you
another illustration. When I went to a certain town
to preach, the ladies, some of whom were even from
another congregation, began insisting on having a
ladies&rsquo; Bible class. They said that the preacher over
at this other church wouldn&rsquo;t have one. I asked why.
They answered, &ldquo;Because it always dies on his hands,
and leaves a bad feeling&mdash;a feeling of failure.&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll have one and not let it die.
We&rsquo;re just going to continue it twelve weeks. Then
we will be through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I planned a twelve-week course. The interest and
attendance grew throughout the twelve weeks. Some
insisted upon its being continued longer but I said,
&ldquo;No, we may start another one soon, but we&rsquo;ve finished
this one.&rdquo; You know there&rsquo;s a big difference
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
between quitting because you&rsquo;ve finished and quitting
because you&rsquo;ve failed. You can always start again
if you think it wise to do so. It is prudent to set a
time limit on all activities of the church except those
which are essential or already established.</p>
<p>When I was doing missionary work in Richmond,
Virginia, I didn&rsquo;t ask churches to send me &ldquo;a contribution;&rdquo;
I asked them to send me a definite amount
for a definite period of time. Then, when they had
promised, they felt obligated to give that much for
that length of time. You know, if there isn&rsquo;t some
agreement about the amount and the length of time,
people will think, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s got to stop sometime
and the church has as much right to discontinue it
or say when it should be discontinued as the preacher
has,&rdquo; and so after awhile it just plays out. But if a
congregation promises to send you $10 a month for
twelve months, they are almost certain to do it.
That&rsquo;s just another one of those little details. All
such things have to be worked out according to human
judgment. They have to be learned by experience
and observation. The Bible does not specify
them.</p>
<p>I could go on talking like this indefinitely, but all
these items are mentioned for illustrative purposes,
and to emphasize the one central point I want to
drive home tonight. That is, that God has left a field
in which he has not made specifications, in which
we must make decisions, and those <i>decisions ought
to be made thoughtfully</i>. They ought to be made deliberately,
and every little detail ought to be studied
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
most carefully, for after all, <i>we are engaged in the
greatest work on this earth!</i></p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Point of Diminishing Returns</span></h3>
<p>I want to raise one more question and then we&rsquo;ll
have to close. We hear people speaking in the business
world about &ldquo;the point of diminishing returns.&rdquo;
Maybe I should tell you what that means or give you
a simple illustration. Suppose you drive out on a
muddy road like Brother Estevez was talking about
this afternoon and get your car real dirty and come
home to wash it. You turn on the hose pipe and go
over it one time, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like the same
car. The first going over makes a big difference, a
very obvious difference, but you don&rsquo;t have it clean
yet. You go over it again and you get it a little bit
cleaner, but it&rsquo;s not as noticeable this time. Then you
get some soap and wash it real good and get off some
more dirt, but the difference doesn&rsquo;t show very plainly
this time. The car still isn&rsquo;t clean. You take some
cleaning wax and go over it again and get off a lot
more dirt. Then you can take a rag and shine it and
the more you polish it, the more it&rsquo;ll shine, but after
awhile you reach the point where the extra lustre
that can be added by further rubbing is not worth
the effort. That&rsquo;s the point of diminishing returns.
When you&rsquo;ve reached the point where the additional
result obtainable is not worth the effort required to
obtain it, that&rsquo;s the point of diminishing returns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>With that in mind, I want to ask this question: Do
you believe that one can ever reach the point of
diminishing returns in his preparation for the work
of the Lord? If by ever so much effort I can make
myself, even to a small degree, a better preacher,
don&rsquo;t you believe I ought to do it? If by ever so
much effort, one can become, to any extent whatsoever,
a better song leader, don&rsquo;t you believe he ought
to do it?</p>
<p>And if by ever so much study and careful thought
and planning, the overseers can make the work of the
church even slightly more effective, don&rsquo;t you think
they ought to do it? Do you believe we can ever reach
the point of diminishing returns in the work of the
Lord? Don&rsquo;t you agree that in his work all of us
should do our very, very best? I believe you do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we have time to say tonight. In just a
moment we&rsquo;re going to sing the invitation song that
has been announced, and in doing so we shall be
urging you to accept the Lord&rsquo;s invitation.

<p>We are very glad to have visitors with us today. I
will not undertake to name those who are present
from other places, lest I omit one. But we want all
of you to realize that you have a very hearty welcome.
We&rsquo;re always glad to have you worship with us.</p>
<p>I was very glad indeed to hear that splendid report
given by Brother Gregory. I wish we could have more
frequent reports from those who are being assisted
in their work by the Chapel Avenue congregation.
Let us remember that the gospel is being proclaimed
today at half a dozen, or maybe a dozen, different
places by preachers supported, at least in part, by
the congregation here. To me, that is a very encouraging
thought.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you this morning upon the topic,
&ldquo;Congregational Objectives and Activities.&rdquo; The
work of the church may be outlined in several different
ways, but the most practical outline that I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
been able to develop is one based upon the <i>objectives</i>
of the church. In other words, what is the purpose
of the church? What is the work that it should
do, and how can it best do that work? I have listed
on the board six or seven expressions according to
which the scriptural objectives of the church may
be classified: evangelistic, devotional, instructional,
watching or looking after the members individually,
practical training, beneficent, and incidental&mdash;some
other activities which are incidental to these main
objectives. These are Scriptural objectives. They are
authorized by the word of God, and I believe that
this outline covers everything which God intends
for the church to do. Someone told me I had omitted
recreational and social objectives. Well, I left those
out on purpose, because I do not believe that they
are authorized by the Bible. Hence, as far as I&rsquo;m able
to know, this list is complete.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about one or two of these items
at this time. Continuing the effort to give some practical
lessons, I&rsquo;m laying aside rhetoric or any other
technical requirements for a good sermon which
might stand in the way of practical effectiveness.</p>
<p>By the term evangelistic, of course, we mean
preaching the gospel to the entire world. The Scriptural
authority for that is found at many places in
the Bible. For instance, the great commission as reported
by Mark 16:15: &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach
the gospel unto every creature. He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not
shall be damned.&rdquo; This commandment is very comprehensive.
It says &ldquo;Go into all the world&rdquo; and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
world includes the people who live here at Chapel
Avenue, those who live next door to you, even those
who are in the house with you. It includes the people
of this city, and then, of course, people in other
cities and other states throughout the entire world.
Therefore, we shall discuss this subject of evangelization
under two headings: local and missionary.</p>
<p>God has given us a charge to keep as a congregation.
He has charged us to preach the gospel unto
the people of this community, as well as the people
of other communities. Now the question is: &ldquo;How
can we do it?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s the command; it&rsquo;s a general
one. God charges us to preach the gospel unto the
people who live in East Nashville, and as little as
you may have thought about it, there are many
thousands of people right here within a few blocks
of our building who do not know about the church
in the New Testament&mdash;who do not believe and study
the Bible and are not acquainted with the distinguishing
characteristics of the New Testament
church.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Preaching on Lord&rsquo;s Days</span></h3>
<p>Our problem is to get the truth unto these people.
What means and what methods shall we use in carrying
out this charge which God has given us? One
method we use is that of preaching on the Lord&rsquo;s
day; Sunday sermons serve an evangelistic purpose
to some extent. Some of the lessons are designed for
the purpose of reaching those who are on the outside,
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
and, of course, when that is the case, a special
effort should be made to get the outsiders here to
hear the lessons. These regular Lord&rsquo;s day meetings,
then, and the lessons which are presented morning
and evening can be made to serve the purpose of
evangelizing this community.</p>
<p>But we could not confine all the lessons to that
type of thinking, for to do so would be to neglect
some other important matters. Even if we did make
all the lessons of an evangelistic nature that would
not suffice to solve this problem, for that means alone
will not reach all the unsaved, even of our own community.
Too many of them are at home at this hour,
or worshiping at some other place where the full
gospel is not presented.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Protracted Meetings</span></h3>
<p>Most congregations supplement their Lord&rsquo;s day
preaching then by what is called protracted meetings,
or revival meetings. Such meetings accomplish
much good, and they should be executed with a definite
purpose in mind. Some definite purpose should
characterize every activity of the church. When we
hold another protracted meeting, we want to think
of it as a means of helping us carry out the God-given
charge to preach the gospel unto the people in
East Nashville. As long as there is one soul within
our reach who has not heard the truth or who has
not been properly exhorted to obey it, you and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
have not finished our job. Keeping the purpose of
reaching the unsaved of this community clearly in
mind as we plan and conduct our next meeting will
contribute much to its success.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Advertising</span></h3>
<p>You will agree with me that if we should depend
entirely upon Lord&rsquo;s day preaching and upon protracted
meetings, we would never reach all the unsaved
even in our own community. God has not prescribed
that our efforts shall be confined unto these
methods. He has given us a general charge to preach
the gospel to all the world. He expects us to use some
intelligence and some good judgment in carrying
out this command.</p>
<p>And, friends, he expects us to use every means
which is at our disposal in order to make the job
complete. Of course, I mean every Scriptural or legitimate
means. For no other sort of means would
accomplish the purpose intended. We would make a
very serious mistake, then, if we relied upon any one
method alone. God expects us to use every method
that is legitimate within its nature in order to carry
out this charge.</p>
<p>What are some of the other things which can be
done along this line? First, we can make a greater
effort to get people to come to the meetings&mdash;supplement
the public meetings by putting on a special
effort to get people to attend them. Newspaper advertising
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
would be very helpful. Personal visits and
invitations to attend the meetings can be used to
good advantage. Another means of attracting people
to the place where the gospel is preached, is publicizing
reports of what is being done. Nothing succeeds
like success. And <i>if a church will do what God
intends for it to do, it will be news</i>!</p>
<p>One preacher blamed the churches themselves for
not getting more newspaper publicity. He said &ldquo;If
there were a church which practiced what it
preached, it would get its name in the headlines of
the daily paper.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ll stop to analyze his statement,
you&rsquo;ll almost have to admit that he told the
truth. We are not seeking publicity for its own sake,
but the Bible says &ldquo;Let your light shine,&rdquo; and condemns
the putting of your candle under a bushel
where no one can see it.</p>
<p>When the church does something which is worthwhile
and would serve as a fine example for others,
it is our duty to give it the publicity which it deserves
in order that others may profit by the example. Such
is authorized by the commandment, &ldquo;Let your light
shine, that others may see your good works and glorify
God.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Radio and Press</span></h3>
<p>Another means which might be used to carry out
this charge is radio preaching. Of course, there has
been much of this done already in the city of Nashville,
but there are many other places where it has
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
not been done, and where it should be used as one
of the methods of carrying out the commandment
to preach the gospel to the whole world. Wherever
the radio is used every possible effort should be made
to form personal contact with those who become interested.</p>
<p>I know a number of congregations that are publishing
short articles in the daily paper. The daily
paper is a very fine medium through which to reach
the public. The business world has known this for a
long time. That&rsquo;s the reason you see so many and
such costly advertisements in our daily papers. Our
merchants know that this is an effective way to reach
the public. Jesus said that the men of this world are
for their own generation wiser than the sons of light.
It may be that this statement is applicable here, for
too often churches have overlooked the use of the
radio and especially the use of the daily paper as a
medium through which to reach the public.</p>
<p>Remember, God has charged us to preach the gospel
to everybody, and one soul is worth more than all
the money in the world. If by ever so much use of
the daily press, we can accomplish the salvation of
just one soul it would be worth a million times what
it cost. If we will stop to consider the value of just
one soul, we will see the great importance of using
every means that we can to win lost souls for Christ.
Now, I&rsquo;m just naming some different activities here
which will help us to fulfill this duty, or to reach
the objective of evangelizing our own community.
Do not think that this list is complete; it is intended
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
rather to be suggestive. Perhaps you can think of
other means which would also help in accomplishing
this task.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Distributing Tracts</span></h3>
<p>But even after we have done all these things there
will still be some people who are not yet reached.
The church here has been engaged in publishing
and distributing tracts. This is another means which
we can use to reach our neighbors. I wish we had
some system of regularly placing tracts, appropriate
tracts, in every home in this community. We can
help to preach the gospel to the world by carrying
tracts in person to those who live in our neighborhood,
and by placing tracts in public places&mdash;the
Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., the bus station,
the Union Station, and other such places. The
churches of Christ in general have neglected this opportunity;
if you doubt this statement, visit some of
these places&mdash;hospitals, terminals, etc.&mdash;and you will
realize that we have been letting an opportunity slip
by us in this respect.</p>
<p>Then our tracts in the church lobby may be used
to serve a good purpose. I&rsquo;m glad that Brother Billingsley
has taken the initiative in providing some
racks for them, because the truth should be displayed
just as effectively as possible. I believe that you will
agree that in the past the tracts in the lobby have
not been attractively arranged. If I should preach
a sermon as ragged in its appearance as that display
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
of tracts has been, you would fire me. You&rsquo;d say you
didn&rsquo;t want the truth wrapped up in that sort of a
garment. We need to look out after details and take
advantage of every possible means to make the
preaching of the gospel more effective. Paul said,
&ldquo;For though I be free from all men, yet have I made
myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might
gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as
under the law, that I might gain them that are
under the law; to them that are without law, as
without law, (being not without law to God, but
under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that
are without law. To the weak became I as weak,
that I might gain the weak: I am made all things
to all men, that I might by all means save some. And
this I do for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, that I might be partaker
thereof with you&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:19-23).</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Personal Evangelism</span></h3>
<p>In addition to all these methods, personal evangelism
should be greatly emphasized. Here is perhaps
the greatest weakness in the method of the churches
of Christ today. On this point, we are allowing some
advocates of error to run circles around us. Here is a
great unworked field which, when properly worked,
will bring results of which we have not yet dreamed.</p>
<p>The Bible does not command people to come to
our public meetings. If we can reach them by these
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
public meetings, that&rsquo;s fine. If we can persuade them
to come so that we may preach the gospel to a large
number at once, that&rsquo;s fine. But what will we do
for those who don&rsquo;t come? The Bible says &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; We
have not fully discharged our duty when we invite
people to come to us. And we haven&rsquo;t always invited
them! There are, I am sure, hundreds of people living
almost in sight of this building who have not
received a personal invitation to attend the meetings
at this place.</p>
<p>They ought to receive at least a personal invitation.
But even then, that&rsquo;s not sufficient. If they still
don&rsquo;t come, it becomes our duty to go to them. Have
we obeyed the great commission, even in reference
to East Nashville, until we do so? It will help a great
deal if we have a prospect file, both general and
individual. Every good insurance agent in this town
has a prospect file. He knows to whom he will try to
sell insurance in the next few days. And we ought to
use the same practical common sense in executing
the work of the Lord that men use in selling insurance.</p>
<p>I went to a place one time to hold a meeting where
they had made very elaborate preparations. They
had appointed many committees. They had an advertising
committee, a publicity committee, a parking
committee, a flower committee, and an ushering
committee, and everything else you can think of except
one little item. They had failed to consider who
might be saved during the meeting, and when I asked
one of the elders whom he expected to be baptized,
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
he hesitated, thought for a while, and finally named
one of the boys who had been coming to the services.
They expected to have forty or fifty additions, but
they had never thought about who these additions
would be.</p>
<p>What would you think of an automobile salesman
with no prospects in mind, who went in on Monday
morning and told the sales manager that he was
going to sell five automobiles during the week? The
sales manager would probably ask, &ldquo;Well, to whom?&rdquo;
The agent would reply, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; I just
believe there must be five people in town who&rsquo;ll buy
from me this week.&rdquo; Do you think the sales manager
would be encouraged? Why he would realize
that the salesman didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking
about. Every congregation ought to have a prospect
list, and every individual worker in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom
ought to have a prospect list. Whom will you
try to save during the next twelve months? Every
Christian should be a soul winner for Jesus, and you
can lead someone to Christ if you are willing to be
used by him in so doing. There is much more that
could be said along this line if time permitted.</p>
<p>One congregation has used very effectively the
method of community Bible classes. When the members
could not get people to come to their meeting-house,
they carried Bible classes to the communities
where the people lived. Some good Christian who had
the respect of his neighbors invited those neighbors
to his home for Bible study and had the preacher
there to help with the teaching. At Richmond, Virginia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
most of the additions which they have had
during the last six months have come from just such
a source. If this little method were put in effect in
the city of Nashville by all the congregations, it
would revolutionize this town in just a few months.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Case of Mary Doe</span></h3>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m trying to impress upon your minds
is that we have not been using all the means or
methods which God has placed at our disposal. Let
me make the point just as concrete and effective as
possible by using a definite example. (Maybe it&rsquo;s indefinite
in some respects.) Suppose that we have a
young lady brought up here in our own community,
maybe not living more than two or three blocks
from our church building. We will call her Mary
Doe. What are the chances that she will learn the
truth from our program of evangelism? We&rsquo;ll say
that she has been reared by parents who go regularly
to a denominational church. They&rsquo;ve been
taking her there ever since she was a tiny baby.
They&rsquo;ve taught her to believe in their particular denomination.
They have built up within her a denominational
pride and a sense of loyalty to the
church of her parents.</p>
<p>At that church, she never hears the complete plan
of salvation. She hears some nice, moral lectures. She
goes to the Bible classes and discusses current events
and general social problems. If she&rsquo;s like many such
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
young people, she does not read the Bible very systematically
herself. She may read it occasionally, but
not consistently and understandingly. The chances
are that Mary Doe will never learn the proper division
of the word. She might live in such an environment
for fifty years and never learn the difference
between the old covenant and the new covenant.</p>
<p>Perhaps she and her mother ride by our building
sometime and she says, &ldquo;Mother, what church is
that?&rdquo; The mother replies, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the church of
Christ&rdquo; or maybe she&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;The Campbellite
church. They think baptism alone saves you.&rdquo; Well,
Mary Doe believes that, even though it isn&rsquo;t true.
Consequently she&rsquo;ll probably never come to one of
our meetings. Very likely she&rsquo;ll never read any of our
literature. How shall we reach Mary Doe?</p>
<p>Probably her best chance to learn the truth is
through her contact with our own children in the
public schools. That is a common meeting place, and
I suspect Mary will be more likely to have an intimate
contact with a member of the church at school
than at any other place. Had you ever thought about
that as an opportunity for evangelizing East Nashville?
I wonder if our boys and girls in school are
taking advantage of their opportunity. Have you
realized what a wonderful opportunity it is, and are
you behaving yourself in such a way as to demand
respect from your fellow students that you may be
able to teach them the truth? Or do you so misbehave
that you would be a little bit embarrassed to undertake
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
to show them the difference between truth and
error? There is a golden opportunity for personal
evangelism that might be used even by a school boy
or girl in leading many people unto the Lamb of
God that takes away the sins of the world. Personal
evangelism then may be carried out through personal
contact at school, through personal contact at
work, and through personal contact at play or in our
social relationships.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="sc">House To House Calls</span></h3>
<p>And, finally, my friends, it might be possible that
before we could reach Mary Doe and the several
thousand people whom she represents, we would
have to start down the street and go from house to
house and call upon every home. It could be possible
that Mary would not be thrown with any member of
the church, even in her association at school. Do you
believe we can claim to have fully and completely
met our responsibility, in preaching the gospel to the
people of East Nashville, until we have gone from
house to house as the apostle Paul did, and as some
denominations are doing today, and taken the message
to them? That is almost an unused opportunity
and method of preaching the gospel to those who
have not yet heard it, and yet it is a very practical
and a very effective one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">IX</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Prayer</span></h3>
<p>I would like to climax all of this by saying that
prayer should be used in our effort to carry out the
great commission. If you have faithfully and diligently
engaged in all of these activities mentioned, and
any others of like nature that could be mentioned,
then you can consistently pray to God to help you in
accomplishing your purpose. That&rsquo;s the reason I put
prayer at the end of the list. For prayer should not
be used without being accompanied by every possible
effort on our part. Neither of these methods, nor any
other that might be named, should be used exclusively.
They should all be used, working together
to help us fulfill our obligation to preach the gospel
to our neighbors.</p>
<p>Now I had hoped to have time to talk about the
other phase of the first division of our outline&mdash;preaching
the gospel to other communities&mdash;but the
clock on the wall says that the time is gone and so
we have to close with the promise that there will be
more to follow. If you&rsquo;ll come back tonight, I&rsquo;ll give
you a mimeographed outline of the lessons which are
being used both this morning and tonight.</p>
<p>In just a moment we&rsquo;re going to sing the song that
has been announced. That is our means of urging
you to accept the Lord&rsquo;s invitation to come to him
and let him save you. If you have been guilty of
committing just one sin which has not yet been forgiven,
that sin must be forgiven before you can go
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
to heaven, because no sin can enter there, and no sin
can be forgiven for those who have never obeyed
the gospel by faith (Acts 16:31-33), repentance (Luke
13:3), confession (Acts 16:37), and baptism (Acts
2:38). Those who have turned aside since being baptized
may be forgiven if they&rsquo;ll come back repenting,
confessing their faults, and praying for forgiveness.
The gospel invitation is yours. While we stand and
sing we urge you to accept it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">XIII</span>
<br />CONGREGATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES
<br />(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>
<p>I promise you in the beginning that I do not mean
to discuss all of this outline (See <a href="#Page_196">pages 196</a>-198)
at this time. It covers in a general way the entire
program of work that God wants His church to do.
The scope of this work is so broad that we have to
break it down in order to study it practically and
effectively. Those who are directing the work of
the church need to study it in its separate parts as
well as in its entirety. This main list of objectives&mdash;evangelistic,
devotional, instructional, looking after
members individually, practical training, beneficent
work, and incidentals&mdash;covers the field entirely. Every
Scriptural function of the church is included in at
least one of these general headings. I do not mean
that the lists of activities under the main headings
are complete. They are not necessarily so. In most
instances they are incomplete. They are <i>suggestive</i>
rather than <i>exhaustive</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Use of Outline</span></h3>
<p>I would like for you to take this outline home with
you and study it with two or three questions in mind.
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
First, what can you do to help advance the work of
the church? Look over this list of activities and write
into this outline any others which, in your judgment,
would be scriptural in nature and help to make the
work of the church more effective. These objectives
are Scriptural, therefore, we want to do everything
in our power to reach them. In order for the church
to attain these objectives, it must have the co-operation
of every member. There is something in this
general program that <i>you</i> can do! Perhaps you&rsquo;ll
find <i>many</i> places where you can be of service, and
you know it is your duty to render whatever service
you can to make the Lord&rsquo;s work as successful as
possible.</p>
<p>These objectives being Scriptural, this outline may
help the overseers in their work of edifying the
church. Please remember that we are engaged in
the greatest work in all the world&mdash;the work of saving
souls! We are undertaking to accomplish a divine
task, one which has been assigned to us by the God
of heaven. In His work we ought to do our very
best, remembering that one soul is worth more than
all the material wealth in the world. We should leave
nothing undone that will contribute toward our
success.</p>
<p>Some constructive work was done in our business
meeting this afternoon. A committee was appointed
to plan the missionary program of the church for the
year. This committee is to give some very careful
study to the selection of the most appropriate fields
and the amount that should be invested in each. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
results of their study, including the program they
recommend for the next fiscal year, will be announced
at the next meeting of the overseers. This
is a very practical step. It is a definite step in the
right direction. It pertains to Item No. 2 under our
evangelistic objectives as shown on the outline.</p>
<p>Another committee was appointed to study our
Sunday morning Bible school program and to make
recommendations for improving it. That&rsquo;s Item No.
2 under our instructional objective. So that makes
two items on this list that will be given very careful
study by committees that have been appointed for
that purpose. We know that our Thursday evening
meeting has been very much improved by giving a
little more thought to planning the program. I believe
that that meeting can be even further improved,
and I am also convinced that similar improvements
may be brought about in every other
phase of the church&rsquo;s work if the proper study and
careful planning is devoted to it. I am hoping that
every item in this outline will be given thoughtful
consideration by those who are responsible for the
work at Chapel Avenue for the sake of improving
every phase of our work and worship.</p>
<p>We are told to seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness. God would not be pleased with a
secondary place in our lives, and that means, among
other things, that our program of work in the church
should be given our best thought, our most careful
consideration, and our most diligent support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Sending Messages</span></h3>
<p>I want to say a few things tonight under Item No.
2 of our evangelistic program. God tells us to go into
all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature.
We discussed some methods this morning that
might be used in carrying out that responsibility in
our own neighborhood. Now, the question arises,
&ldquo;What can we do about preaching in communities
that are too far away to receive any direct benefit
from our local program of services and personal
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One method which we have been using recently
is that of distributing tracts. We have published 70,000
tracts for free distributions. Bro. Shacklett reported
this afternoon in the business meeting that
the most of this supply has already been distributed.
He probably has enough calls on his desk now to
more than exhaust the remainder. If it is not too
optimistic to assume that each one of those tracts
has been read by at least one person, that&rsquo;s the
equivalent of preaching a sermon to 70,000 people,
which certainly is no small consideration!</p>
<p>And I happen to know that those who are selling
tracts on a commercial basis, at least some of them
best known to me, are making from 100 to 200 per
cent profit. The tracts that cost us less than 1 cent
each, are being sold by those who are in it for the
money at 2&frac12; cents each. That means that by spending
less than one penny we can give to these missionary
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
fields a service that would cost them on the
market 2&frac12; cents. Therefore, from a financial point
of view, by giving away tracts instead of giving the
money with which to buy tracts, we are making a
great saving.</p>
<p>The response that has been received from this
work is very encouraging. If we had time, we
would like to read some of the letters that have been
received. In addition to the tracts distributed by
Chapel Avenue, the church at Madison has made a
very wide distribution of one of the same tracts, and
is now contemplating publishing 100,000 with which
to answer the calls they are receiving. That seems
to be one good means of carrying the gospel to those
of other communities who have not heard it. And,
remember, it is our duty to use every legitimate
means at our disposal.</p>
<p>The next item on your outline is radio preaching.
There has been some talk of a national radio program,
and no doubt that would do a great deal of
good. There is some question as to whether the
money that such a program would cost might not
accomplish more good if spent in some other way.
That&rsquo;s a question which I, personally, would not
know how to decide. But we do know that the radio
is being used very extensively on a local basis in
various missionary fields of our country, and those
who are engaged in that work are pleased with the
results.</p>
<p>However, trying to whip the devil by using the
radio is somewhat like trying to whip the Germans
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
by fighting them from the air. A great deal can be
accomplished but the battle cannot be completely
won until we go in person. Radio work, to be as effective
and fruitful as it ought to be, must be followed
up by personal contact. Those who become
interested by means of radio preaching ought to be
contacted and encouraged to render complete obedience
to the commandments of the gospel.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Sending Money</span></h3>
<p>A third way in which we can help to attain this
objective of preaching the gospel to the entire world
is by sending financial support to missionary fields
and to preachers working in those fields. In that respect
the church at Chapel Avenue has been very
active and no doubt will continue to be. In fact, we
have just about gone as far as we can go with the
present means at our disposal, and I think it would
not be out of order to tell you that in the business
meeting this evening another man was put on the
payroll at $200 per month, on a temporary basis,
hoping that when the congregation learns about it,
they will increase their contribution enough to cover
this cost. Those who are managing the financial affairs
believe that the present income is not sufficient
to warrant this additional expense, but they have
acted upon their faith in you, upon their confidence
in you, that your knowledge of this increased need
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
will bring about an increased response. I do not believe
that you will betray that confidence!</p>
<p>The man added to the payroll has a family of six
children and recently resigned a job paying him several
hundred dollars per month as district manager
for an insurance company in order to devote his entire
time to preaching the gospel. With a charter
membership of about ten souls, twenty-four people
were present for the initial meeting last Lord&rsquo;s Day.
This man seems to be well qualified for the task
which he has undertaken, and we believe he will
accomplish great results.</p>
<p>There are certain items listed in your outline
which we believe should characterize our work of
supporting missionaries. It is my conviction that regular
and complete reports should be received from
those who are being supported. Brother Estevez made
a fine talk along that line here last Sunday afternoon.
Brother Gregory gave us a splendid report of
his work this morning. I believe that one reason the
Chapel Avenue church has continued to be so vitally
interested in the work at Kingsport is that one of our
elders is on the job there and keeps the congregation
here acquainted with what is being done.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the workers to be used in these fields
should be selected very carefully. You ought to be
just as careful about selecting some man to preach
for you in North Carolina as you are about selecting
some one to preach for you here. It seems to me
that the two cases are exactly parallel in that respect.
We ought to be just as much concerned about who
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
preaches for us over there as we are about who
preaches for us here. If such a policy were followed
by all the churches it would bring about a distinct
improvement and prevent considerable embarrassment.</p>
<p>In addition, the man selected should be well supported.
It&rsquo;s worth just as much to preach in Kingsport
or North Carolina or Louisiana or some other
place as it is to preach in Nashville, and when the
men have equal responsibility and equal qualifications,
it seems to me that they ought to be equally
well supported. Certainly the man in the field ought
to be supported well enough that he will not be
cramped in his work or distracted by concern about
how he will meet the next month&rsquo;s grocery bill.</p>
<p>Remember that it is <i>our</i> work when we send a man
out to a field like that, and it would be inconsistency
and folly on our part to send one without supplying
him with the resources necessary for the success of
his work. Something in addition to his bare living
ought to be provided. He should have funds with
which to operate. Think about how much it costs
to carry on a program of work here, by way of advertising,
maintaining a meeting place and supporting
a radio program and all that sort of thing. In
some ways it is more expensive in those fields than
it is here. For instance, we have fifty other congregations
in Nashville to help us advertise the cause of
Christ in this city. In those fields the little mission
church has to take all this responsibility by itself. It
has to bear all the cost of supporting a radio program,
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
publishing articles in the daily paper, and of
carrying on all of these varied activities that are
listed under our local program of evangelism.</p>
<p>No business concern would send a man to some
field to represent it and work for it without furnishing
him with the support necessary for success in his
work. I am convinced that it would be wiser and better
in the long run to have a few men in the field
fully supported than to have several that are but half
supported, and therefore handicapped and unable to
accomplish what should be accomplished.</p>
<p>It is also my conviction that the church which furnishes
the money is also obligated to supervise the
use of that money. I do not suggest that we dictate
to churches at other places, for there is no one who
believes more firmly in congregational autonomy
than do I. Every congregation must be entirely independent.
But, surely, if you have a man preaching
for you in the state of North Carolina, or some other
place, it is your duty to know what he is doing, what
he is accomplishing, and whether it would be well
for him to continue there or to move to some other
community.</p>
<p>I know of one man who was supposed to be preaching
in a missionary field, not supported by Chapel
Avenue incidentally, concerning whom I have received
a report that the only thing he did was to
teach a Bible class on Wednesday night. Over a period
of several months he received a good income
from churches throughout the country who were gullible
enough to answer a call without knowing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
condition of the field and the kind of work that was
being done by the one who made the call; while
being paid to preach he was working at a secular
job, receiving a living wage therefor, and putting the
money he received from the churches in the bank in
his own name. This illustrates what I mean by saying
that it is necessary that we keep a line on those who
are being supported. Those who are worthy will welcome
investigation and those who are not worthy
certainly ought to be investigated.</p>
<p>I believe that I am, at least to some extent, qualified
to speak here for I have worked at both ends
of the line. As you know, I spent five years at Richmond,
Virginia, in the missionary field, receiving support
from you and others back home. I&rsquo;ve also worked
at this end of the line, and I think I know a little
about how such work ought to be done. Surely regular
and complete reports ought to be received, and
careful supervision should be exercised by those who
furnish the money. It is my conviction that, when
God places resources in the hands of an individual
or a congregation, they are responsible for seeing
that those resources are properly used.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I am reluctant to tell a rich man
how to give away his money. If he had sense enough
to make it, he probably has more sense about how to
spend it than someone who could never make any.
Of course one should teach the principles that are
revealed in the Bible concerning the use of money,
but I believe that the responsibility of spending one&rsquo;s
money rests primarily upon the one to whom God
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
has entrusted the money, and that will apply to a
congregation as well as to individuals.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">A Three-Cornered Affair</span></h3>
<p>Now arranging a program of missionary work is a
three-cornered affair. There is first of all the <i>missionary
field</i> in which the work is to be done, and
next, there is the <i>preacher</i> who is to do the preaching
and third the <i>church</i> to do the financing. By
some means or other these three must be brought to
an agreement upon a plan of procedure. That means
that somebody must take the initiative in getting the
work started.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few members who live in the missionary
field take the initiative, and undertake to
find a preacher and someone to support him. They
contact a preacher and ask him to come and work
for them. They contact some church or churches and
ask them to support the man while he works for
them. Whenever there is enough leadership in the
mission field to take such initiative, that&rsquo;s all right.
But that is presupposing a goodly degree of leadership
in a mission field! There are many mission fields
which do not possess such leadership. Sometimes the
few members who live in these mission fields are relatively
indifferent. They are not always so. Sometimes
they are the finest people on the earth, but often they
are not. And maybe the reason it&rsquo;s still a mission
field in many instances is because they are not as
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
wide awake and zealous as they should be. So if a
great many fields are ever reached, some of them
not having any members at all, someone else must
take the initiative.</p>
<p>In other instances, the preacher takes the initiative.
He selects a field to which he would like to go
and then he gets some churches to support him while
he does so. That&rsquo;s the plan I used in going to Richmond.
It sometimes works all right and sometimes
it doesn&rsquo;t. For very often a preacher who undertakes
to do such work is comparatively inexperienced, and
is not nearly as well qualified to plan the program
of work as some congregation that helps support him
would be. When I went to Richmond, twelve years
ago, one had to do it that way, because at that time,
so far as I know, no one congregation considered
itself able to assume full responsibility for the support
of a missionary. But I do not believe that this
is the most satisfactory method.</p>
<p>In the third place, the congregation itself very
often takes the initiative, selects a field, selects a
preacher, and sends him there to work. Bro. Gregory
gave us an example of that this morning. He told
of a congregation which made thorough investigation
of the places needing a preacher in East Tennessee
and finally concluded that Kingsport would be the
most advisable place for them to help. They&rsquo;ve been
following that plan for many years. Bro. Charles
King has been on their payroll for quite a long time.
Several years ago they sent a committee to East Tennessee,
at an expense of $150, to select the best place
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
for him to preach. At that time they decided in favor
of Harriman, where there is now, I understand, a
strong congregation.</p>
<p>In this case, you see, the church took the initiative;
the church selected the field after proper investigation;
the church selected a preacher and paid
him a salary and supported him while he represented
them in that field. Where this can be done, it seems
to me to be a very fine plan. Hence, one way for an
established congregation to contribute to the success
of evangelizing the world is to take the initiative not
only in planning, but also in supervising the work.
With such an arrangement the work will be promoted
according to the judgment of a seasoned and experienced
group of elders rather than according to
the judgment of some young, inexperienced fellow
who gets the idea that he wants to be a missionary.</p>
<p>A few objections to this plan have come from
preachers on the field. It has been said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
have twenty churches supporting me than to have
just one. For that one might get discouraged at my
pessimistic report and cut me off.&rdquo; The answer to
that is that there should be a more definite agreement
on the part of the preacher and the church as
to how long he is to be supported. The man on the
missionary field should not expect a guarantee of a
lifetime job. And, furthermore, if his reports were
too pessimistic, it may be that his support <i>should</i> be
discontinued. Or perhaps he ought to be advised to
discontinue his activities in that field and to move to
some other. It would not have been well for Paul to
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
have remained indefinitely in the city of Athens. According
to the inspiration guiding him, it was better
for him to move on.</p>
<p>I would have welcomed counsel and advice from
those supporting me when I was working in Richmond.
There were about twenty different churches
supporting me&mdash;too many for me to confer with each
of them to get advice on questions that arose; and
consequently in most instances I relied only on my
own judgment, which meant that the work was being
directed by the judgment of one young preacher
rather than by the combined judgment of some experienced
group of elders. And nothing would have
given me greater encouragement than for a committee
of elders of some church that was supporting me
to have spent a few days in Richmond studying the
situation and advising me on the problems which
arose. There were times when I wondered if the
results being accomplished justified the money being
spent.</p>
<p>Of course, the money was well spent. For growing
out of that work which I entered twelve years ago
there are now two self-supporting congregations. One
of them has a building completely paid for and supports
a full-time preacher. The other has a part-time
preacher. Coming from one of these congregations,
a young man graduated from David Lipscomb last
spring and has gone back to Virginia to preach the
gospel in his native state. Another young man from
one of these congregations is now at Lipscomb preparing
himself to preach the riches of Christ. On the
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
side, some work and encouragement were given at
Norfolk, Virginia, where there is now a growing
and prosperous congregation. These developments
have come about in only twelve years. But I couldn&rsquo;t
see it then. Oftentimes I became discouraged. If
some one congregation had been supplying all the
necessary support and supervising the work, it would
have been very helpful to me.</p>
<p>But after all, friends, when you contribute only
five or ten dollars per month to a place, you are not
likely to have a vital interest in the work. To give
you a concrete example, an elder and treasurer of a
church in Middle Tennessee which sent ten dollars
each month to Richmond, year after year, spent several
days in Richmond on a social visit and didn&rsquo;t
even come around to see what was being done. Well,
they only had $10 per month invested there and so
they were not particularly interested. But if they&rsquo;d
been spending $200 a month, paying the full salary
of the man on the job, then an elder who spent the
week end in town would have looked into the situation!
Where a man&rsquo;s treasure is, there will his heart
be also!</p>
<p>In fact, I have said, and I&rsquo;m about to say again,
that to contribute just $5 a month here and there
and elsewhere for mission work is somewhat like giving
a nickel to a beggar on the street. Do you know
why you give that nickel? Not because you are interested
in the beggar and not because you are concerned
about what he is doing, but to ease your own
conscience. You are seeking to purchase ease of conscience
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
with expenditure of a mere nickel! If the
beggar is worthy, he ought to have more than a
nickel; if he isn&rsquo;t worthy, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve even a
nickel. And so when a congregation merely contributes
five dollars to each of a few places, to soothe
their conscience, they can say, &ldquo;Yes, we are doing
some mission work,&rdquo; but certainly they are following
the line of least resistance. They may have purchased
ease of an untrained and misinformed conscience at
a minimum cost, but this does not mean that they
have done their duty in meeting the responsibility
that God has placed on them!</p>
<p>Another way in which Chapel Avenue can and is
contributing to the attainment of this objective, is
by furnishing leadership for rural churches in reach
of Nashville. Bro. Clark, Bro. Shacklett, Bro. Autry,
and others who have been going out, know that there
are many congregations within driving distance of
Nashville which are almost totally lacking in leadership.
They need someone to be there on Lord&rsquo;s Day
to conduct the worship and to teach and encourage
them. And we have an opportunity to do a lot of
good along that line.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Practical Suggestions</span></h3>
<p>Now these are just scattering thoughts and remarks
on what we can do and, therefore, what we <i>ought</i> to
do to attain the God given objective of preaching the
gospel unto the whole world. I advise you again that
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
this list of activities is not exhaustive but suggestive.
The same kind of treatment given this particular objective
could be applied to the others in this outline
as well. We don&rsquo;t have time to do so tonight, but I
want you to study it for yourself and consider how
you, individually and personally, can do something
to help us reach these scriptural objectives. And further,
consider how the church itself may improve its
efforts along this line.</p>
<p>If you think of some change that ought to be made
in this outline, or some items that ought to be added
to it, I would certainly be glad to receive your suggestions.
Friends, remember that we are engaged in
the Lord&rsquo;s work, the greatest work in all the world!
If there is any body of people on earth who ought
to be enthusiastic, it is the church of Christ! We are
working in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, and we know that
our labor will not be in vain. If so much can be accomplished
by the little that has been done, I want
you to think about what could be accomplished if
we were all doing our best! It yet remains to be demonstrated
what can be accomplished by a congregation
which is wholly and completely dedicated unto
the work of the Lord. I recommend that you give a
practical and careful study then to each item on this
list.</p>
<p>Consider our devotional program and how it may
be improved. It can be improved! To claim that
there is no room for improvement would be to claim
perfection which none of us would like to do. Bro.
Murphy has been making some fine suggestions in
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
our Thursday evening work. Those of you who have
missed them have been missing an opportunity to
improve the effectiveness of your own service in the
kingdom of God. He&rsquo;s made some <i>practical</i> suggestions.
You may think some of them are not good, but
certainly every suggestion he has made should be
given very careful consideration by those who are
supervising and taking part in the work here.</p>
<p>Perhaps our greatest sin is our failure to put into
use the knowledge which we receive, to make practical
use of suggestions offered. It would be easy just
to let Dr. Murphy&rsquo;s advice pass by and go unheeded.
If we do that, it will mean that the church will be
very little better off after this eight weeks of training
than it was before. But, if his suggestions are promptly
and faithfully heeded, the church will be a great
deal further along toward the accomplishment of its
scriptural objectives than it was before.</p>
<p>You will notice that the Wednesday evening meeting
appears three or four times in this outline and
might appropriately appear at even some other place.
For instance, the Wednesday evening meeting may
be used for devotional purposes. It may be used for
instructional purposes and will be for the next eight
weeks. It may also be used for the purpose of giving
practical training to those who would be workers in
the kingdom of God. If we&rsquo;ll think about it like that,
you see, it will give purpose to our mid-week meetings.</p>
<p>Here are scriptural goals. God is holding us responsible
to do everything we can to attain these objectives
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
promptly and effectively. Our mid-week program
can be made to serve a very important purpose
in the attainment of these ends. And, therefore, along
with every other scriptural phase of the work, should
receive the wholehearted co-operation and support
of every member.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to much greater things for
the church at Chapel Avenue in the weeks, months,
and years ahead. Don&rsquo;t you want to have a part in it?
If there are some here tonight who live in our community
and would like to work and worship with the
church here, we invite you to make that known by
coming forward tonight. If there are those who
have backslidden, you are invited to follow the Bible
plan of repenting, confessing your faults, and praying
for forgiveness, that God may save your soul.
And, of course, you who have not been baptized, if
you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, if you will
repent of your sins and confess your faith and obey
the commandment to be baptized for remission of
sins (Acts 2:38) God promises that your sins will be
forgiven, washed away by the blood of Christ, and
you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit! Christ invites
you to come to him and let him save you! Will
you accept that invitation while together we stand
and sing?</p>

<br />HOW MUCH IS LIBERAL?</h2>
<p>The subject of giving has been assigned to me for
this occasion. This assignment pleases me for two
reasons: First, it is a popular subject. Folk like to
hear it because it hits them so hard. In the second
place, it is a vital question. Those who have taken
the time to count the instances say that the Bible
mentions money more often than it does faith, repentance,
confession, and baptism all put together.
&ldquo;The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&rdquo;
Whether, therefore, we base our judgment on the
danger of our sinning with respect to it, or the
amount of space devoted to it in the Bible, the subject
of money, or giving, is a very important one. I
am approaching the subject from the standpoint of
this question: &ldquo;How Much Is Liberal?&rdquo; The reason
for this approach will appear as we proceed.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">New Testament Authority</span></h3>
<p>You know, as well as I, that in every instance we
must go to the New Testament for our guidance in
matters religious. Our people have been thoroughly
taught, but not too thoroughly, that we are no longer
bound by the laws given to Moses and Noah, but by
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
the law of Christ. In studying the subject of giving,
therefore, we must go to the New Testament.</p>
<p>In First Corinthians 16:2 we read: &ldquo;Upon the first
day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
gatherings when I come.&rdquo; This Scripture teaches that
we should give regularly, weekly (not weakly). The
giving is to be just as regular as the eating of the
Lord&rsquo;s supper&mdash;upon the first day of each week. This
quotation also teaches that we should give according
to our prosperity. The more prosperity one has the
more he is expected to give.</p>
<p>A third New Testament requirement is cheerfulness
in giving. &ldquo;God loveth a cheerful giver&rdquo; (2 Cor. 9:7).
Sometimes it is said that we ought to give
until it hurts. It is all right to give until you can miss
what you give, or until you have to do without something
that you want. But you should never give
until it hurts. It is all right to give until you can miss
hurt you to give as God requires. He loves a cheerful
giver.</p>
<p>Fourthly, we are taught to give purposely. The
Christians at Corinth made a purpose a year in advance
and were commanded to give as they had
planned. &ldquo;Every man according as he purposeth in
his heart, so let him give&rdquo; (2 Cor. 9:7). They had
not only purposed but they had expressed their purpose
and when a Christian does that, it very nearly
becomes a promise. The text does not specifically
say that we should make a purpose, but it implies it;
and if we purpose, we should give accordingly. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
reference to this question on which we are so likely
to stumble we ought to do some prayerful planning,
lest we make the mistake of not giving as we should.
The temptation to give sparingly is so great that one
can not afford to depend merely upon the impulse
of the moment. Make a purpose or plan and then
give according to your plan.</p>
<p>Finally, the New Testament commands us to give
liberally. &ldquo;He that giveth, let him do it liberally&rdquo;
(Rom. 12:8, A.R.V. or footnote in the A.V.). The
word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; comprehends both the attitude of the
giver and also the amount of the gift. The New Testament
does not specify any amount or percentage
that we should give. It does not tell us to give any
certain amount or percentage of our income; but it
does command us to give liberally. You have often
heard the statement, &ldquo;We are not commanded to
give a tenth.&rdquo; This statement is literally true, but it
may imply an error. The inference is that the New
Testament assures us that we need not give as much
as a tenth. Such an inference is false. The New Testament
does not command us to give <i>less than</i> a
tenth. It names no definite amount and no definite
percentage.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 9:5-7 we are not only taught to
give liberally but we are encouraged to do so by the
statement: &ldquo;He which soweth sparingly shall reap
also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall
reap also bountifully.&rdquo; It appears to me that the New
Testament thus puts us on our honor. If it had
named a certain number of dollars or a certain percentage
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
of our income, we might just give that
amount and claim the rest to do with as we pleased.
But God has placed us on our honor, the amount of
our giving to be determined by general instructions
and our love of Him and those to whom we give.
When an honorable man is placed on his honor, it
seems that he should do even more than when he is
under definite laws. Some schools have what they
call &ldquo;the honor system.&rdquo; According to this system, the
teacher may put a test on the board and leave the
room. The students are on their honor. It seems to
me that one would be less likely to cheat under those
conditions than with some one on guard. The New
Testament puts us on our honor, so to speak, with
only general instructions and commands to guide
our giving.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Individual Responsibility</span></h3>
<p>Each individual must answer for himself this question:
&ldquo;How much is liberal?&rdquo; The Old Testament
required a certain percentage; the New Testament
requires liberality. <i>How much is liberal?</i> What does
the Bible mean when it says, &ldquo;give liberally?&rdquo; Liberality
would not mean the same amount in every
case. Some must give more than others. This story
was published some years ago in the <i>Gospel Advocate</i>:
There was a certain rich man in a congregation
who had as much money as all the other members.
When money was being raised for any purpose
he would propose to give as much as any other <i>one</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
When the congregation was trying to raise money
to put a new roof on their building, he arose, according
to his custom, and said, &ldquo;Brethren, I will give as
much as any other man in the house toward putting
on this new roof.&rdquo; There happened to be a rich infidel
present that day, who arose and said, &ldquo;Well, Mister,
you and I will pay for the new roof; I will give
half the cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if you expect me to tell you exactly how
much you should give, you will be disappointed. I
am not going to tell you because the Bible doesn&rsquo;t
tell me. If I were to undertake to tell you, I might
put it too low. I would certainly be afraid to tell any
one that he was giving too much. A man once asked
me a question which several other preachers had been
unable to answer. He said, &ldquo;My wife and I make $150
per month. We give $25 of that to the church each
month. I want to know if we are giving enough.&rdquo;
When I heard the question I knew why the other
preachers had not answered. He and his wife were
giving more than a tenth. They were giving 16&#8532;
per cent, but I was afraid to tell him whether they
were giving too much or not enough, because I didn&rsquo;t
know. Jesus Christ watched the poor widow give
away all her living, and He didn&rsquo;t tell her that she
was giving too much. Some of our brethren today
would probably have said, &ldquo;Just wait a minute, lady,
we appreciate your motive and admire your liberality,
but you ought not give all you have. We wouldn&rsquo;t
want you to starve to death or to do without the necessities
of life.&rdquo; But Jesus stood there and watched
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
her give away the very last thing she had and He
made no effort to restrain her. So, I can&rsquo;t tell any one
that he is giving too much or the exact number of
dollars that he should give. Each one must answer
for himself.</p>
<p><i>How much is liberal?</i> I can&rsquo;t answer for you; you
can&rsquo;t answer for me. You must answer for yourself
and your answer must be a definite one, expressible
in terms of a certain number of dollars and cents.
You must decide how many dollars and cents you
should give in order to meet the requirement of liberality.
How much have you studied the question?
How much have you prayed about it and investigated
the word of God in your search for an answer?
How much time have you spent on the question?
Are you sure that you have reached a scriptural
conclusion? You must not merely decide what is liberal
according to your own standard, but what is
liberal according to God&rsquo;s standard. For, after all,
God is to be the final judge as to whether you are
giving liberally. You must reach a definite conclusion
as to what God will consider a liberal amount from
you. I urge you to study the question of liberality.
Search the Scriptures, pray God to lead you to the
right answer. Because the question must be answered.
It is a commandment of God in the New Testament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Abram</span></h3>
<p>Although the New Testament does not, and I can
not, tell you definitely how much is liberal in the
sight of God, we can get some light on the question
by studying what God has required of his people in
other dispensations. In the 14th chapter of Genesis
there is an account of four kings who went to war
against five other kings. The four kings won the war
and among the captives was Lot, the kinsman of
Abram. &ldquo;And when Abram heard that his brother
was taken captive, he armed his trained servants,
born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen,
and pursued them unto Dan.&rdquo; With this small band
of men he won a great victory over the four kings
and their powerful armies and rescued Lot and his
goods and his people. After his return from this
battle Abram met Melchizedek, priest of God, and
gave him tithes (a tenth) of all. God wants you and
me to know that Abram gave a tenth.</p>
<p>The book of Genesis is very brief. In a very few
pages, less than the number I hold in my hand, God
has given us the history of the world for a period of
several thousand years. It is very brief. If man had
written such a history, the volumes would have filled
a shelf all the way around this room. Men have written
many volumes of history concerning the United
States which has been a nation for less than two hundred
years. But God has condensed the history of
the world, for a period of thousands of years, within
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
these few pages. Yet, he took enough of that precious
space to tell us that Abram gave a tenth. If man had
written an account of this war, he would have told
the names of the captains in each army, how many
men were killed, how many were wounded, how
much the war cost, and so forth. God omitted all
those things of interest, but he did take the space
to tell us that Abram gave a tenth and that he prospered.
He even repeated this information in the New
Testament, where he says, &ldquo;Now consider how great
this man [Melchizedek] was, unto whom even the
patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils&rdquo;
(Heb. 7:4). He had some reason for wanting us to
know this, for He has a reason for everything He
does and says. He took the space to tell us twice that
Abram gave a tenth, and Abram prospered. You may
draw your own conclusion from these scriptural and
vital facts.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">IV</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Jacob</span></h3>
<p>Turning on over to the 28th chapter of Genesis
we find another interesting story that throws some
light on our question. Jacob had taken Esau&rsquo;s blessing.
Esau was angry. Jacob was afraid Esau would
kill him. For refuge he went to Padanaram. On the
way he spent the night at Bethel, and slept in the
open, with a rock for a pillow. I don&rsquo;t know why he
chose such a hard pillow. People do some strange
things. I have heard that in days gone by the Oriental
people slept with their feet, instead of their heads, on
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
the pillow, because the feet did the harder work. According
to that rule I think I know some people who
ought to change ends with the pillow. While Jacob
was sleeping with a rock for a pillow he had a strange
dream. He saw a ladder reaching from earth to
heaven and the angels of God going up and down
(not down and up) on it. The Lord stood above it
and promised to be with Jacob and to bless him.
When Jacob arose early in the morning he vowed a
vow saying, &ldquo;If God will be with me, and will keep
me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to
my father&rsquo;s house in peace; then shall the Lord be
my God: and this stone which I have set for a pillar,
shall be God&rsquo;s house: and of all that thou shalt give
me I will surely give the tenth unto thee&rdquo; (Gen. 28: 20-22).</p>
<p>With this vow in his heart Jacob continued his
journey to Padanaram, where he spent twenty-two
years and became very wealthy. As he was returning
to Canaan we find him praying to God as follows:
&ldquo;O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, &lsquo;Return
unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal
well with thee&rsquo;: I am not worthy of the least of all
the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast
showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed
over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands
...&rdquo; (Gen. 32:9-10). Please note that twenty-two years
ago he had passed over this Jordan with nothing but a
stick in his hand and in his heart a vow to give one
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
tenth of all his increase to God. In the meantime he
has become very wealthy.</p>
<p>The extent of his wealth is partially indicated by
an incident that followed. Jacob was afraid that Esau
was still angry. (He should have known that Esau
was too lazy to stay mad twenty-two years.) To find
grace in the sight of Esau he sent him a present, a
token of his good will. Such presents usually represent
only a small fraction of one&rsquo;s total possessions.
Yet this is what Jacob sent Esau: &ldquo;two hundred she
goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and
twenty rams, thirty milk camels with their colts, forty
kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals&rdquo;
(Gen. 32:14, 15). Few farmers in this county have
that much livestock, yet that represents a small fraction
of what Jacob was worth and had acquired since
crossing the Jordan twenty-two years before. Since
that time, he had been giving one-tenth to Jehovah.
Again, remember that God has taken space to tell
you and me about that in this much condensed book,
the book of Genesis. He evidently meant for us to
get some lesson from these facts.</p>
<p>During a financial depression, a business man in
Kansas went broke. He lost everything he had and
found himself $50,000 in debt&mdash;fifty thousand dollars
in the hole. A friend of his offered to give him
a medical formula to be used in any way he saw fit.
The man took the formula and went home. He
turned to Genesis 28:22 and drew a ring around
these words: &ldquo;Of all that thou shalt give me I will
surely give the tenth unto thee.&rdquo; With that vow, now
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
become his vow, he began to manufacture a medicine.
You probably have some at home. It was Mentholatum.
On the bottle or tube you will find the
name of A. A. Hyde. When I first heard this story
he had become a millionaire and was still giving one-tenth
of his income to what he considered the work
of the Lord.</p>
<p>In private conversation I told this story to some
one who said, &ldquo;Well, he can afford to give a tenth,
because he is rich.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Yes, but remember
that he was $50,000 in debt when he began doing
so.&rdquo; It is easier for one to give a tenth when he is
poor than when he is rich. A man who practiced
giving a tenth said that when he was working for
$1.00 per day it was easy to give 60 cents on Sunday;
but when he began making $500 per week and had
to give $50 on Sunday, it was hard to do. It is easier
for a poor man to give liberally than it is for a rich
man to do so. That may be one reason the Bible says
it is easier for a camel to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">V</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Jews</span></h3>
<p>Now, back to the Old Testament. You know the
Jews were required to give a tenth of their income
and even more. Some Bible students say the requirement
was &sup2;/&#8321;&#8320; all the time and &sup3;/&#8321;&#8320; every third
year. That is not entirely clear to me, but we do
know that they had to give a tenth and in addition
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
to that, they had to make daily, weekly, monthly and
annual sacrifices. So at the very least, they gave more
than a tenth, and you know that the Jews were a
prosperous people. For some reason God tells us
about all these Old Testament characters who gave
a tenth and prospered while doing so. They were
required to give a tenth. The New Testament commands
us to give liberally. Now, which is more? Of
whom does God require and expect more&mdash;those who
give a tenth or the ones who are told to give liberally?</p>
<p>Now, I could stand up here and give you many
more examples of those who gave a tenth of their
income and were blessed while they did so. A man
in Richmond, Virginia, who had himself and a wife
to support, was making only $20 per week. He purposed
to give a tenth to the church. Later, he became
sick and his remuneration was only $10 per week. He
continued to give $2.00 per week to the church. He
soon recovered, returned to work, and was promoted
to a position that paid $75 per week.</p>
<p>My wife and I had another good friend at Richmond,
Virginia, who gave $5.00 out of her $35 per
month salary. One month, after meeting all necessary
expense, the $5.00 that she had set apart for the
church was all she had left with which to buy a new
spring dress and you know how much a young lady
wants a new dress in the spring. After debating the
question for awhile she overcame the temptation and
gave the $5.00 to the church as she had planned. The
next day her employer, who was not a Christian and
who knew nothing of the battle the young lady had
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
fought and won, gave her enough material to make
two new dresses.</p>
<p>I could continue compiling such examples indefinitely.
If you think a tenth is too much for one to
give, ask the man who has tried it. I never knew any
one to discontinue the practice of tithing after trying
it for a while. Experience proves that it is a good
practice. A church in Dallas, Texas, has a large sign
on the wall of its building which reads as follows:
&ldquo;If any member will practice giving one-tenth of all
he earns for one year and at the end of that time can
say that he has been made poorer by doing so, we
will give him $1,000 in gold.&rdquo; No one has claimed
that $1,000.</p>
<p>The church at Lily Chapel, near Portsmouth,
Ohio, doubled its contributions. That meant, of
course, that some of the members were even giving
more than twice as much as they had been giving.
One night I requested that all who had been made
poorer, or who had less left to live on, as a result of
increasing their contribution, raise their hands. Nobody
raised a hand. Then I said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
double it again, then?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">VI</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Blessings</span></h3>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t give away enough and that is
the reason they don&rsquo;t have enough left to pay their
bills. If you are having trouble making &ldquo;tongue and
buckle meet,&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t have the necessities of life,
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
I suggest that you start giving more to the Lord&rsquo;s
work. Then you will have more left to live on. This
may not sound like good arithmetic; but it is good
Bible teaching. &ldquo;He that soweth sparingly shall reap
also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully shall
reap also bountifully.&rdquo; &ldquo;The liberal soul shall be
made fat&rdquo; (Prov. 25:11).</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, there is no man
that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake
and the gospel&rsquo;s but he shall receive an hundredfold
now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters,
and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions;
and in the world to come eternal life&rdquo; (Mark
10:29, 30). That is a wonderful promise. It does not
apply to those who give for the sake of handsome
returns; but to those who give for the sake of Christ.
Those who give for His sake shall receive a hundredfold
in this life. Do we believe the Bible? Then why
don&rsquo;t we give more? Many do not believe the above
promise. They do not believe that all necessary
things will be added to those who seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness. They are afraid
they will come to want if they give liberally. Instead
of giving liberally and trusting God&rsquo;s promises they
try to provide for themselves by holding on to what
they have. They should heed the words of the Bible:
&ldquo;There is that withholdeth more than is meet [suitable],
but it tendeth to poverty&rdquo; (Prov. 11:24).
Christians need more faith. We need to believe that
&ldquo;it is more blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
believe any one was ever made poorer as a result of
giving, if he gave according to the Bible. To do so
would be to disbelieve the word of Almighty God.</p>
<p>May I insist again that you give prayerful consideration
to this question: &ldquo;How much is liberal?&rdquo; Ask
yourself, &ldquo;How much must I give in order for the
Lord to consider me a liberal giver?&rdquo; This question
must be answered to the satisfaction of the Lord Almighty.
When a widow can give all she has without
being reproved by the Lord, do you believe that God
will be pleased with less than a tenth from you? In
the light of what God required of the Jews do you
believe that one-tenth exceeds the demands of liberality?</p>
<p>If all the members of God&rsquo;s church gave a tenth
[which they certainly could do and still have plenty
left] the contribution of the average congregation
would be at least four times as much as it is at present.
Think of the good work that could then be supported.
We could preach the gospel to the entire
world in a short time; we could take care of all the
poor; we could count the elders that rule well worthy
of double honor (1 Tim. 5:17).</p>
<p>How many Jews did it take to start a congregation
and support a priest? It took only ten. Wherever
there were ten Jews they could employ a priest and
support him with their tithe, or tenth. The priest
was required to give a tenth also. This left each
in the group &#8313;/&#8321;&#8320; to live on and meet other obligations.
How many Christians does it take to support
a preacher? In this age, it takes from one hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
to one thousand so-called Christians to keep one man
busy in the work of the Lord. In the light of this
comparison, how do you think we will stack up with
the Jews on the Judgment Day? Why does a congregation
of five hundred, or one thousand, members
do but very little more than a congregation of one
hundred members? Even if it takes one hundred
Christians to support one preacher, why can&rsquo;t a congregation
of five hundred, or one thousand members
support five, or ten full-time workers in the Lord&rsquo;s
vineyard? Is it not because the members of the average
congregation are content to give barely enough
to carry on a local program that is respectable in the
eyes of the public? Such a limited conception of
what is needed is not a scriptural standard of giving.</p>
<p>The New Testament requires liberality. The Jews
had to give a tenth, and more. We must give liberally.
Let us be sure that we meet this New Testament
requirement. Let us prove our faith by our
giving. Let us obey God and trust His promises. Let
us give liberally, and watch the growth in our individual
and congregational prosperity.</p>
<p>I want to leave just one more thought before closing.
I suppose you are glad to be here, grateful for
your existence on the earth. Most people are. Very
few are tired of living. God blessed you when he
gave you your life on this earth. I will tell you how
you can get a blessing still greater&mdash;by giving your
life to God. &ldquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo;
If you were blessed when you received your
life, you will be more blessed by giving your life in
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
obedient service to your Maker. &ldquo;I beseech you therefore,
brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
God, which is your reasonable service&rdquo; (Rom. 12:1).
Give your life to Jesus. Live for Him who died for
you.</p>
<p>While we stand and sing we entreat you to accept
the Lord&rsquo;s gracious invitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">XV</span>
<br />AND SUCH LIKE</h2>
<p>You and I ought to be very thankful to the Lord
for the opportunity to meet and worship Him. Such
a blessing is not universal. It is exceptional in the
history of the world, and I am glad to see people
show their appreciation of this blessing by taking
advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Will of Christ</span></h3>
<p>As many of you well know, the New Testament
teaches that the law of Moses is not binding on
Christians today, but that we should follow the law
of the Spirit of life in Christ. This means that the
Ten Commandments, as such, are not today binding,
but the principles involved in the Ten Commandments
are binding in so far as they have been included
in the law of Christ. Frequently, when I make
such a statement someone replies, &ldquo;Do you mean
that we may do as we please? Do you mean that it&rsquo;s
all right to kill today? That it&rsquo;s all right to steal?&rdquo;
Evidently the Holy Spirit knew that people would
ask such questions and, therefore, the 5th chapter of
Galatians was written. &ldquo;Stand fast therefore in the
liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold,
I, Paul, say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testify again to
every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to
do the whole law. Christ is become of no effect unto
you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye
are fallen from grace. For we through the Spirit wait
for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Jesus
Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should
not obey the truth? This persuasion cometh not of
him that calleth you. A little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump. I have confidence in you through the
Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but
he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever
he be. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision,
why do I yet suffer persecution? then is
the offence of the cross ceased. I would they were
even cut off which trouble you. For, brethren, ye
have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty
for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even
in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But
if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye
be not consumed one of another. This I say then,
Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust
of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary
the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit,
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
ye are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh
are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings,
<i>and such like</i>: of the which I tell you before, as I
have also told you in time past, that they which do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
against such there is no law. And they that
are Christ&rsquo;s have crucified the flesh with the affections
and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also
walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain
glory, provoking one another, envying one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact that we are not bound by the law of
Moses then does not mean that we can do as we
please. This Scripture plainly says, &ldquo;Ye cannot do
the things that ye would.&rdquo; We are restrained by the
law of the Spirit. We are restrained by the law of
love. &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo; In
order that we may clearly understand what this implies,
the Holy Spirit has listed for us the works of
the flesh and the fruits of the spirit. This list is the
basis of the lesson which I want to present this morning.
I have the items on the board. Perhaps those in
the back of the building cannot see them. But at least
we shall refer to them as we go along and you will
get the picture anyway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Works of the Flesh</span></h3>
<p>Let us look at the works of the flesh first. The
Bible plainly says that those who follow the works
of the flesh shall not enter the kingdom of God. If
you find yourself guilty of one or more of these works
of the flesh, then remember that you are on the outside,
that you will remain on the outside until you
repent and obey God. People who follow the works
of the flesh simply cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven.</p>
<p>1. <i>Adultery and Fornication.</i> The first four in the
list are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, and lasciviousness.
All four of these words have reference to
immorality. Some state legislatures make a distinction
between adultery and fornication, using the word
adultery to apply to immorality on the part of married
people, and the word fornication to apply to
the same sort of sin on the part of unmarried people.
Therefore, those words cover exactly the same sort
of crime&mdash;illegitimate relationship between men and
women. I don&rsquo;t know just how prevalent this sin is
in the world&mdash;I have no statistics on that point, and
would not be particularly interested in gathering any,
but I do know that such sins are very common, and I
know that you know whether you are guilty. If you
are guilty the Bible says that you cannot enter the
kingdom of heaven. You must repent of that sin and
have it washed away by the blood of Jesus before
there is any hope for you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>2. <i>Uncleanness.</i> This word probably covers a little
more territory than either of the first two words. The
best definition I know for uncleanness is found in
Romans 1:24: &ldquo;Wherefore God also gave them up to
uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to
dishonor their own bodies between themselves: who
changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped
and served the creature more than the Creator, who
is blessed forever. For this cause God gave them up
unto vile affections; for even their women did change
the natural use into that which is against nature;
and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of
the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;
men with men working that which is unseemly; and
receiving in themselves that recompense of their error
which was meet.&rdquo; If I were to talk an hour, I
could not give a clearer definition of what is meant
by uncleanness. It is obviously a work of the flesh,
and all who are guilty stand condemned in the sight
of God Almighty.</p>
<p>3. <i>Lasciviousness.</i> This term is apparently still
more comprehensive. It not only includes general
acts of lewdness and abandoned sensuality but is
sometimes used to describe that which tends to produce
voluptuous or lewd emotions. For instance,
&ldquo;The lascivious pleasing of a lute&rdquo; (Shakespeare).
The plural of the noun form is found in Romans
13:13 where it is translated wantonness. &ldquo;Let us walk
honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife
and envying.&rdquo; Referring to this text Thayer&rsquo;s Greek
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
Lexicon quotes the following definition of lasciviousness
from Fritzsche: &ldquo;wanton acts or manners, as
filthy words, indecent bodily movements, unchaste
handling of males and females, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There may be some who would not (at least think
they would not) actually become guilty of adultery
but who do allow themselves to daydream about
things which are unclean and immoral. Such unholy
meditations are liable to produce wanton and lewd
desires and may even lead to an overt act of immorality.
You should study the meaning of the word
lasciviousness and diligently avoid the sin it describes.
&ldquo;But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
thereof&rdquo; (Rom. 13:14).</p>
<p>4. <i>Idolatry.</i> We turn now to a different sort of
transgressions but we are still talking about works
of the flesh. Everybody knows what idolatry means.
If a man worships something other than the God of
heaven, he is guilty of idolatry. If one values anything
in this world more than he esteems God and
his relationship to God, he is virtually guilty of
idolatry.</p>
<p>5. <i>Witchcraft.</i> Then comes the sin of witchcraft,
or sorcery, which, I believe, includes what is commonly
called fortunetelling. It is condemned both
in the Old Testament and also in the New Testament.
It is a work of the flesh. Friends, if it is wrong
to practice the fraud, the craft, the art, (or whatever
it is) of fortunetellers, then it&rsquo;s wrong to patronize
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
them, for when you do so you are giving them
both your financial and moral support.</p>
<p>6. <i>Hatred.</i> Hatred is a sin of the disposition. It is
an attitude of the heart. It is the state of being an
enemy. This term describes aversions and antipathies
which are opposed to brotherly kindness and love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that these words were intended to be
arranged in logical order, but I do believe we can see
some sequential significance in the order of the word
hatred and the three which follow just as we did in
the first four.</p>
<p>7. <i>Variance.</i> This word means contentions. It is
hatred in action, manifesting itself in contests, altercations,
lawsuits, and disputes in general.</p>
<p>8. <i>Emulations.</i> This word signifies envious and
contentious rivalry or jealousy, which often are associated
with hatred and variance. Jealousy is strife
to excel at the expense of another. It is destructive,
not constructive. When you are jealous you try to
pull the other man down in order to get above him.
But you can&rsquo;t do it! In the effort to injure another
you sink lower yourself.</p>
<p>9. <i>Wrath.</i> This is the climax of the last four words.
Wrath is hatred in violent action. It consists of turbulent
passions which disturb the harmony of mind
and produce domestic and civic broils and disquietudes.
(Once I used Jiggs and Maggie of comic strip
fame as an example of wrath when they were throwing
pots and pans at each other, but someone corrected
me by saying that Jiggs never threw any, they all
came from the other direction! But anyway the point
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
of the illustration was clear.) When hatred, variance,
and jealousy break out into violent action, that&rsquo;s
what is described by the word wrath. Herod&rsquo;s jealousy
became wrath when he killed the babes of
Bethlehem in an effort to destroy Jesus.</p>
<p>These last four are sins of the disposition. In some
instances they are committed, especially the first
three, by people who come to worship every Sunday
and pass as devoted Christians. But friends, I want
you to see what ugly company they are keeping. They
are classed by the Holy Spirit right along with idolatry,
adultery, uncleanness, and lasciviousness. That&rsquo;s
mighty bad company, isn&rsquo;t it? We are inclined to be
more tolerant of sins of the disposition than of sins
of immorality, but we&rsquo;d better be very careful how
we appraise sins without Biblical authority. God has
put them all in the same catalogue, and therefore
sins like hatred and jealousy will send you to hell
just as quickly as idolatry or adultery. If you&rsquo;re guilty
of any of them, you must repent before you can go
to heaven for people who continue in the work of
the flesh cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>10. <i>Strife, Seditions, Heresies.</i> The word &ldquo;strife&rdquo;
represents a courting of distinction, a desire to put
one&rsquo;s self forward, contention and wranglings with
a partisan and factious spirit which tends to result
in division. The word &ldquo;sedition&rdquo; suggests the act of
dividing. It means dissension. The word &ldquo;heresies&rdquo;
applies to the parties or sects arising from diversity
of opinion and aims.</p>
<p>Note, therefore, that division is condemned in
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
every stage of its development. The disputing, arguing,
wrangling, and vanity which lead to it are condemned
by the word strife. The act of separating
into parties is condemned by the word &ldquo;divisions&rdquo;
or &ldquo;seditions,&rdquo; and the parties themselves are condemned
after they occur by the word &ldquo;heresies.&rdquo;
Again I call your attention to the fact that God puts
these sins in the category of fornication and adultery.
The very disposition to divide is wrong; the act of
dividing is wrong; and the parties and sects which
result from the division are likewise wrong. Division
is evil from beginning to end. It is a work of the
flesh and all of those who are guilty of it, who encourage
it, who endorse it, or who support it, morally
or financially, will be condemned as following
the flesh rather than following the spirit.</p>
<p>11. <i>Envying.</i> This is another sin of the disposition.
The best definition I have found of envying is
this: &ldquo;Pain felt, and malignity conceived, at the sight
of excellence or happiness.&rdquo; Did you ever notice
someone who is happier than you or more successful
than you, and as a result feel some sort of pain
within you, or some sort of uneasiness? Well, that&rsquo;s
envy. It is pain felt or malignancy conceived at the
sight of happiness or success on the part of another.</p>
<p>After reading in some religious paper a glowing
report of a very successful meeting, a preacher may
have a strange feeling of discontent or chagrin which
self-analysis would show to be the result of his natural
(fleshly) reaction to the success of a brother
evangelist. Is not this a case of envy? Is it not a
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
work of the flesh? Can those who do such things
enter the kingdom of God?</p>
<p>Preachers are not the only ones who are tempted
to envy each other. Business men, doctors, school
teachers, young people in their social relationships
may all be guilty of this sin and must guard against
it. If you cannot see your boy friends or your girl
friends be more popular or successful than you without
having a feeling of uneasiness and a disposition
to harm them in some way, then you are guilty of the
sin of envy, and a murderer can come just as nearly
going to heaven as one who is guilty of envy. Because
they are both works of the flesh and stand condemned
by Jehovah.</p>
<p>12. <i>Murder.</i> We don&rsquo;t need to comment upon the
word &ldquo;murder.&rdquo; You know what it means. You can
be guilty of murder at heart. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whosoever
hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know
that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him&rdquo;
(1 John 3:15).</p>
<p>13. <i>Drunkenness.</i> Everybody knows what this sin
is. It&rsquo;s the work of the flesh, and those who are guilty
of it will be lost. And there&rsquo;s only one way to be absolutely
certain that you won&rsquo;t get drunk&mdash;just don&rsquo;t
drink of anything that&rsquo;s intoxicating. If you never
take the first drink of beer, if you never take the
first cocktail or sip of whiskey, then you&rsquo;ll never get
drunk. But if you do take the first one, you don&rsquo;t
know what may happen.</p>
<p>14. <i>Revelings.</i> Reveling signifies lascivious feasting
with obscene songs and music, feasts and drinking-parties
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
which are continued until late at night
with unclean songs, dissolute conduct, and boisterous
merrymaking. Those occasions when people turn
themselves loose and do not observe proper restraints
of natural desires, are occasions of revelry. Remember
&ldquo;that they which do such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Fruits of the Spirit</span></h3>
<p>In contrast with the works of the flesh let us look
at the fruits of the Spirit. They are the fruits which
will be produced in the life of one who is following
in the Spirit. They are the characteristics which will
adorn the life of one who obeys God. I want you to
notice how attractive these are. I want you to see how
beautiful this list is.</p>
<p>1. <i>Love.</i> Love for God, for your brother, for your
neighbor, and even love for your enemy is a fruit of
the Spirit.</p>
<p>2. <i>Joy.</i> God expects his people to be joyous. Paul
said, &ldquo;Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord&rdquo;
(Phil. 1:1). &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I
say rejoice&rdquo; (Phil. 4:4). Again we read, &ldquo;And these
things write we unto you, that your joy may be full&rdquo;
(1 John 1:4). As Christian people, those who are following
the Spirit are full of joy. People who are trying
to follow the Spirit and the flesh both are not
full of joy. But those who are truly following the
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
Spirit are joyful, because joy is one of the fruits of
the Spirit.</p>
<p>3. <i>Peace.</i> Peace&mdash;peace with God, with one&rsquo;s self,
and usually with most, if not all, one&rsquo;s fellowmen&mdash;is
a part of the fruit of the Spirit. The calm, quiet,
order, and hope which abide in the heart of a Christian
are more precious than gold. The sinner has
doubts, fears, alarms, and dreadful forebodings.</p>
<p>4. <i>Longsuffering.</i> People who follow the Spirit are
patient; they are not easily provoked; they bear the
troubles and difficulties of life without murmuring
or repining and submit cheerfully to every dispensation
of God&rsquo;s providence.</p>
<p>5. <i>Gentleness.</i> One who is harsh and unkind is
lacking in this fruit of the Spirit. It has been said
that to be gentle means to always do and say the
kindest things in the kindest way.</p>
<p>6. <i>Goodness.</i> This means uprightness of heart and
life&mdash;a constant desire and diligent effort, not only
to abstain from every form of evil, but also to do good
to the bodies and souls of all men.</p>
<p>7. <i>Faith.</i> The word faith is here used in the sense
of fidelity, the character of one who can be depended
upon to keep all his promises, to meet all of his obligations,
and to be true to every relationship.</p>
<p>8. <i>Meekness.</i> Meekness is likewise a fruit of the
Spirit. It is the very opposite of anger. Moses was
called a meek man. Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; And although Christ
was brave and uncompromising, he was nevertheless
one of the very meekest of men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>9. <i>Temperance.</i> Temperance means self-control.
Remember this very chapter says, &ldquo;Ye cannot do the
things that ye would.&rdquo; You cannot give free expression
unto the passions of your body. Your body must
be buffeted and brought into subjection as Paul did
with his. We must learn to exercise self-control and
to make ourselves do that which we know we ought
to do.</p>
<p>These are the fruits of the Spirit. They are the
characteristics that should be developed in your life
if you are a Christian. I just want you to look at these
two pictures&mdash;the fruit of the Spirit on the one hand
and the works of the flesh on the other. They are contrasted
in every sense of the word. They are incompatible
and antagonistic. To the extent you have one
you fail to possess the other.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this question: Do you believe the
fruit of the Spirit will make anybody unpopular?
Sometimes when people are unpopular and are being
persecuted they say, &ldquo;Oh, well, those who live Godly
lives are to be persecuted.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s true. The Bible
teaches it (2 Tim. 3:12). But I&rsquo;m afraid that very
often our persecution comes from other causes. We
might be suffering because we have hatred, jealousy,
and envy, and not because we have the Spirit of
Christ. Before you take pride in your persecution
you&rsquo;d better examine the source of it. It might be
coming from the wrong side of the fence.</p>
<p>Those who follow the Spirit are a living rebuke
to those who fail to do so, and as such they will receive
some degree of persecution. But I also contend
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
that everybody in this world will have to admire a
person who has the fruits of the Spirit in his life.
His character presents a beautiful picture to all who
know him. You just can&rsquo;t help admiring him. Let
us be very careful then about the cause of our persecution.</p>
<p>But I promised to talk to you about &ldquo;And So
Forth&rdquo; or &ldquo;And Such Like.&rdquo; After the apostle Paul
had finished naming the works of the flesh he said,
&ldquo;and such like.&rdquo; He said that there were some
things like those named which also belong in the
same classification. Now suppose you were requested
this morning to come forward and list in this blank
column some things that are like those Paul named.
What would you put in this column? There must
be <i>some</i> things like these. The Bible says there are
some things like them. Otherwise, there would have
been no sense in saying &ldquo;and such like.&rdquo; What are
those things which are like the ones named by Paul?
The Bible itself mentions some others that could be
put in this class. For instance, lying is a work of the
flesh. It could certainly be included in the &ldquo;and so
forth&rdquo; of Paul&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>But now I want to put some words in this blank
column, and leave it up to you to decide whether
they belong under the Fruit of the Spirit or the
Works of the Flesh. From this point on, I&rsquo;m going to
let you preach this sermon. It&rsquo;ll be your sermon from
here on out. I shall not tell you where I think these
words belong. Not that I&rsquo;m afraid or ashamed to tell,
but I want you to make your own decision. For after
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
all, people will not do right until they decide to do so
themselves. If I can provoke you to think and to
resolve in your own heart that you will do right,
then that will be much better than anything else
which I might do for you today. The first word I&rsquo;m
listing is:</p>
<p>1. <i>Dancing.</i> I want you to decide for yourself
which column it belongs in. Would you list it as a
work of the flesh or as fruit of the Spirit? Into which
list does it fit better? I&rsquo;m not going to say. Decide
for yourself. If you were called upon to classify it in
one or the other of these groups, in which group
would you put it? You may say it doesn&rsquo;t belong in
either. Well, I&rsquo;ll still leave that up to your judgment.
I&rsquo;ll put another word up here.</p>
<p>2. <i>Bible Study.</i> (That&rsquo;s two words, isn&rsquo;t it?) Do
you have any trouble classifying that? In which list
would you put it? Would you say that Bible study
belongs with the fruit of the Spirit or with the works
of the flesh? I shall not try to influence your opinion.
Decide for yourself. You see I can put most anything
up here today because I&rsquo;m not committing myself.
I&rsquo;m playing safe. Well, let&rsquo;s list another word.</p>
<p>3. <i>Movies.</i> Not as they could be and not as they
ought to be, and not as they are in some isolated
cases, but as they are in general, would you say that
they look like this crowd (Fruit of the Spirit) or do
they look like this crowd (Works of the Flesh)? Do
they contribute to lasciviousness, do they contribute
to envy and hatred and such like things, or do they
look more like peace, self-control, and goodness? Decide
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
for yourself! I&rsquo;ve asked a great many people this
simple question: &ldquo;Do you believe that movies as they
are in general are helpful to society or injurious to
society?&rdquo; All of the answers to that question except
in one single instance have been on the same side.
I think you know what the correct answer is.</p>
<p>4. <i>Card playing.</i> Let&rsquo;s consider card playing here,
playing bridge, and such like games. Please note what
happened in Cincinnati a few years ago. The city
council passed an anti-gambling law which, of
course, outlawed playing bingo. Some of the preachers
of the city got together and wrote out a petition
asking the city manager to amend the anti-gambling
law to give the churches permission to play bingo in
order to raise money to carry on their work. The
city manager granted the petition. It&rsquo;s on the legislative
record of the city of Cincinnati. Do you wonder
why so many people have quit going to church,
why the buildings are empty on Sunday?</p>
<p>A young lady in Cincinnati told me the first time
I ever saw her that she didn&rsquo;t like to go to church,
that she came away feeling worse than when she
went and that she didn&rsquo;t get what she needed when
she attended the typical place of worship in the city
of Cincinnati. Do you wonder why? Now Cincinnati
may be a little bit extreme, but similar conditions
prevail at a great many other places.</p>
<p>There was a lady in Louisville, Kentucky, who
told me she was alarmed about her son. She said he
was a natural-born gambler. There are a lot of &ldquo;natural-born
gamblers,&rdquo; but they are not all in Kentucky.
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
I asked the lady if she didn&rsquo;t go to bridge
parties, and she said she did. Then I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you contribute your share of the money to buy a
prize?&rdquo; She admitted that she did. Next I asked,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you play a game of chance to see which lady
will take the prize home?&rdquo; Again she answered in the
affirmative. My reply was, &ldquo;Well, you taught your
son to gamble. Why are you alarmed?&rdquo; She was perfectly
content to gamble in the living-room with a
group of so-called refined ladies, but she didn&rsquo;t want
her son to bet on the horse races or go to some
gambling den in the city. (I almost told you where
I thought that one belonged, didn&rsquo;t I? I didn&rsquo;t mean
to do that.) Let&rsquo;s take something else.</p>
<p>5. <i>Prayer meeting.</i> Where would you put attending
prayer meeting? I never heard anybody raise a
question about that. I think everybody knows where
it belongs so we pass on to something else.</p>
<p>6. <i>Petting.</i> We just as well talk about it; everybody
knows about it. Many have been guilty of it. Where
would you put petting? Does it look like lasciviousness,
tending to produce wanton and lustful desires,
or does it look like it belongs with the fruit of the
Spirit? Now about the only difference I see in petting
and dancing is that the dancing is done to music and
the petting without the benefit of music; dancing is
usually done in public, where the presence of others
imposes at least some degree of restraint, whereas
the petting is done in a parked automobile on a side
road or in some living-room with the shades pulled
down. That&rsquo;s about the only difference. I&rsquo;m perfectly
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
willing to leave the decision to your own honest judgment,
because if you&rsquo;re not honest you&rsquo;re certainly
lost anyhow.</p>
<p>7. <i>Tobacco.</i> Maybe you think I&rsquo;m going too far,
but I&rsquo;d like to ask you to classify the use of tobacco.
Would you classify tobacco&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s dipping,
chewing, or smoking&mdash;as a work of the flesh, or as
fruit of the Spirit? Do you believe that using it will
help you to save souls or hinder you in saving souls?
Would you be a little bit ashamed to let the man
whom you were trying to convert see you smoking or
dipping or chewing? Again, I&rsquo;m just asking questions.
Not answering them. If anybody wants to know
what my answer is, see me after we&rsquo;re through and
I&rsquo;ll tell you. But I want to leave it up to your own
judgment. Where would you place these things? Do
they belong in the list of works of the flesh or the
fruit of the Spirit?</p>
<p>Friends, we are talking today about something
that&rsquo;s fundamental. There&rsquo;s no part of the Bible
more fundamental than the 5th chapter of Galatians.
The Bible says those who do these things (works of
the flesh) shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Against these things (fruit of the Spirit) there is no
law. You&rsquo;re perfectly safe when you&rsquo;re on this side.
There&rsquo;s no law of God or man that would condemn
anything in this list. You never heard of a law forbidding
one of these fruits of the Spirit. There&rsquo;s not
a state legislature on this earth that would even think
about condemning one of them. Against such things
there is no law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Perhaps the greatest progress the church of Christ
could make today would be to heed diligently the
lesson of Galatians, chapter 5, and get all of our
thinking, conversation, and conduct in harmony
with the fruit of the Spirit. The very example of the
membership would then be a tremendous drawing
power. It would win the admiration of all those who
observed it. All serious-minded people who want to
go to heaven when they die, would like to have a
part with a group of people who are governed in
such a way. If there are some present this morning
who are guilty of following the lust of the flesh, there
is still a chance for you to be forgiven. If you will
repent, confess your faults, and pray God to forgive
you, he will do so&mdash;that is, those of you who are erring
children of God. You who have not yet been
baptized into Christ may secure forgiveness by believing
in him as God&rsquo;s son, repenting of your sins,
confessing your faith, and obeying the commandment
to be baptized for remission of sins. If you are
subject then to this call of Christ, we invite you to
accept it.</p>

<br />WHAT MUST I DO TO KEEP SAVED?</h2>
<p>Allow me to add a word of welcome to all of you
who are present and especially to the visitors. We are
very grateful for such good attendance at our Sunday
evening meetings, and especially for the large number
of young people present. I know of no better
way to build a courtship, and eventually a marriage
and a home, than upon regular attendance to all the
meetings of the church. I have just learned recently
of one young man who is seriously considering obeying
the Gospel as a result of attending our Sunday
evening meetings with his girl friend. This is an
example of how you young people may do a lot of
good, not only for yourselves but for those whom you
may bring with you. Hence I urge you to come back
tonight to hear Brother Bradford and every Sunday
evening to our program of worship and study.</p>
<p>We had so many questions arising in my class upstairs
this morning that we didn&rsquo;t get to our lesson.
We are taking the same lesson next Sunday, the first
twenty-two verses of the ninth chapter of Acts, and
the memory verse will be Colossians 2:12. If you
want a copy of the questions, you can find them here
on the pulpit at the end of the hour.</p>
<p>We had a fine program last Wednesday evening,
even a bigger crowd than expected. I hope you realize
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
the importance of the training we are giving the
young men on Wednesday evening. It means a lot to
them. They&rsquo;ll be the leaders of the churches in just
a few years from now and they&rsquo;ll appreciate your
presence and encouragement as they conduct our
services for the next five weeks. We are expecting a
good program again this week.</p>
<p>This morning my topic is &ldquo;What Must I Do to
Keep Saved?&rdquo; There have been many sermons, and
rightly so, preached upon the subject, &ldquo;What Must I
Do to Be Saved?&rdquo; That is indeed a very important
question. It is asked and answered three times in the
book of Acts (Acts 16:30-34; 2:36-38; Acts 9:6; 22:16).
These answers teach that in order to be saved,
one must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
the living God; repent of his sins; and then be buried
with Christ in baptism for remission of sins. One who
has done these things is then a child of God, a member
of the Lord&rsquo;s family, a citizen in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom,
a member of God&rsquo;s church; for Jesus said, &ldquo;He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,&rdquo; (Mark
16:16) and God adds to the church day by day such
as are being saved (Acts 2:47). All people then who
have been saved are in the church because God put
them in, just as soon as they were saved.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">I</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Danger of Falling</span></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our purpose to speak at this time on the
topic, &ldquo;What Must I Do to Be Saved?&rdquo; but rather
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
upon one which is equally important, &ldquo;What Must I
Do to Keep Saved?&rdquo; This very question implies not
only the possibility, but even the danger, of one&rsquo;s
falling from grace. If it were not possible for one
who has once been in a saved condition to fall out
of it into an unsaved condition, then our topic would
be entirely out of place. Furthermore, a big part of
the New Testament would be of no value. A great
portion is devoted to warning Christians against falling
and to telling them how to keep from falling.
Every warning in the New Testament addressed to
Christians implies not only the possibility but also
the danger of apostasy.</p>
<p>Simon, the sorcerer, believed and was baptized;
therefore he must have been saved for Jesus said,
&ldquo;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo;
(Mark 16:16). But after Simon had reached that condition,
he endeavored to buy the gift of God with
money, to whom Peter said, &ldquo;Thy money perish with
thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God
may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither
part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right
in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy
wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of
thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that
thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of
iniquity&rdquo; (Acts 8:20-23). Surely Simon was then lost,
although he had been once saved, illustrating the
fact that one can fall from grace.</p>
<p>Addressing the Christians at Galatia who would
be saved by the law of Moses, Paul said, &ldquo;Ye are
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
fallen from grace&rdquo; (Gal. 5:4). Why argue about the
possibility of falling from grace when such a plain
statement is found in the Bible?</p>
<p>If any further evidence could be desired, you can
find much more in the Bible to the same point. For
instance, James, chapter 5, and the last two verses
thereof, &ldquo;Brethren, if any one of you do err from
the truth, and one convert him; let him know, that
he which converteth the sinner from the error of his
way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a
multitude of sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Save a soul from what death? Not from physical
death. &ldquo;It is appointed unto men once to die,&rdquo; physically.
In that sense everybody has to die, the good
and the bad alike. The only death from which you
can be saved is the second death, which means to be
cast into the lake of fire and brimstone (Rev. 20:14,
15; 21:8). This verse says that if you save a sinner
from the error of his way, you have saved him from
the second death. But who are the sinners here addressed?
They are members of the church. Verse 19
says, &ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; you people who have already been
saved, &ldquo;if any one of you&rdquo;&mdash;one of you saved people&mdash;&ldquo;do
err from the truth, and someone convert him,&rdquo;
then he has saved his soul from eternal torment.
Surely this teaches that a brother in the church, who
has been saved, may so sin as to go to hell, and will
go to hell if somebody doesn&rsquo;t convert him.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, the Apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Let him
that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall&rdquo; (1
Cor. 10:12). Let him who thinketh he standeth&mdash;let
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
the man who thinks that apostasy is impossible&mdash;take
heed, lest he experience that which he denies. These
Scriptures then are sufficient to show that there is a
danger of one&rsquo;s falling from grace.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">II</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Power to Stand</span></h3>
<p>Please do not get the impression, however, that
you have to fall from grace. You don&rsquo;t have to do it!
You can stand if you will. If you will stand, God will
give you the power to stand. If you submit your life
unto Him for safekeeping and maintain the right
attitude toward Him, and the right sort of service for
Him, then He will keep that which has been committed
unto Him. You don&rsquo;t have to fall from grace.
Anybody can be saved who wants to. If you don&rsquo;t go
to heaven, it will be because you didn&rsquo;t want to badly
enough to put forth the proper effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize the fact that anybody can go
to heaven who wants to. It is like Brother Freed
used to tell us at school: &ldquo;You can do anything you
want to, if you want to badly enough.&rdquo; A story which
illustrates the point comes from England, where they
are said to dig graves deeper than we do in America&mdash;in
fact, ten feet deep. Instead of having the cemeteries
hard by the church building as we often do,
the story says that they have them adjacent to the
school buildings, sometimes on the school campus.</p>
<p>In one instance they had a graveyard between the
boys&rsquo; dormitory and the administration building. Of
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
course the boys did not walk around it. They made
a path right across it. One day the caretakers digged
a grave ten feet deep across the path and failed to
put up a red light, leaving the grave open during
the night. After it got dark a boy started from one
building to another and fell into the open grave.
He tried to climb out, but the walls were straight
up and down and ten feet high. Finally, he gave up
and sat down in the corner to await developments.
It wasn&rsquo;t long till he heard another boy coming down
the path&mdash;&ldquo;pat, pat, pat.&rdquo; He sat right still, and boy
number two fell off in the grave with him. Then
boy number one said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let a man rest in
peace in his own grave?&rdquo; The second boy jumped
right out of the grave like a cat&mdash;without any trouble
at all. He had a stronger desire to escape than the
first boy did. He was scared worse!</p>
<p>This illustrates the point that you can do anything
you want to if you want to badly enough. If you are
scared enough of hell, you will go to heaven. If you
want to go to heaven more than you want to do anything
else in this world, then you will go there, and
there is no power on earth, or in heaven, or beneath
the earth that can keep you from going to heaven if
<i>you</i> want to (Rom. 8:35). You are the only person
in all this universe who can keep you out of heaven.</p>
<p>Now I may surprise you a little bit when I tell
you that there are not many people who want to go
to heaven. I can prove it by the Bible. The Bible
says that very few <i>are</i> going to heaven, and since anybody
can go who wants to, then only a few want to
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
go. If many wanted to go, then many would go; but
the Bible says that there is a strait and narrow way
which leads to life everlasting and few there be that
find it. But there is a broad way that leads to destruction
and many there be that travel it (Matt. 7:13,
14). Anybody can go to heaven who wants to, but
only a few are going; then only a few want to go.
If you will examine yourself and observe the people
around you, you will soon become convinced that
not many people want to go to heaven.</p>
<p>An illustration which I frequently use on this
point is this: One Sunday afternoon I was talking
to two young ladies who were backsliders. I asked
them if they loved the Lord. They said, &ldquo;Why,
Brother Dark, of course we love the Lord.&rdquo; Then
I said, &ldquo;Do you want to go to heaven when you die?&rdquo;
As you might expect they answered, &ldquo;Why, sure,
everybody wants to go to heaven!&rdquo; My next question
was, &ldquo;Will you be at worship this evening?&rdquo;
They grinned a little bit and looked at each other.
I said, &ldquo;You have some dates, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; They
grinned a little more, and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Your
boy friends don&rsquo;t want to go to church with you, do
they?&rdquo; They grinned a little bit more and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Well, they didn&rsquo;t come to worship that night. I asked
which they loved more, those boy friends or the Lord.
They didn&rsquo;t make any answer.</p>
<p>Now, which do you think they loved the more?
They said they loved the Lord more than they loved
anything else in the world, but they went out with
some boy friends that night instead of coming to
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
worship. They thought they wanted to go to heaven,
and they did want to a little bit; but they wanted
to go out with those boys more than they wanted
to go to heaven. And that&rsquo;s the case with a great
many people. You ask them if they want to go to
heaven and they will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; but there is something
they want to do more. They want to have a
good time, make money, or do something else, more
than they want to go to heaven. That&rsquo;s the trouble
with most people. That&rsquo;s the reason most people are
going somewhere else. God allows people to go anywhere
they want to and if they prefer to go somewhere
else rather than to go to heaven, then they
go somewhere else and He permits them to do it.</p>
<p>Just remember this: you cannot possibly go to
heaven without traveling the road which leads there.
A lot of people would like to go to heaven but they
don&rsquo;t want to travel the road which leads there. They
want to travel some other road and then get to
heaven. Well, you can&rsquo;t travel the road that leads
to Memphis and get to Chattanooga, can you? You
can&rsquo;t travel the road that leads to hell and wind up
in heaven. It just can&rsquo;t be done. So if you want to
go to heaven more than you want to do anything
else in this world and are willing to put forth the
effort required to do it, you can certainly go there.</p>
<p>That to me is a very encouraging thought. My
destiny, under God, is completely within my own
hands. I don&rsquo;t have to depend upon anybody else&rsquo;s
wishes, anybody else&rsquo;s choice or word about it whatsoever.
God wants me to go to heaven, and with
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
that point settled then it is all up to me, and you
can&rsquo;t keep me from going there. Nobody else can, if
I want to go. Nobody can keep <i>you</i> from going!
Sometimes people make excuses, and they blame
others for their failure. They find fault with other
people and say, &ldquo;He did so and so, and therefore I
did so and so.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s no good at all. There is nobody
in this world who can keep you from going to
heaven if you want to.</p>
<h3><span class="smaller">III</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Three Rules</span></h3>
<p>From this point on I shall assume that I am
speaking to people who do want to go to heaven.
On this assumption I can give you three little rules
to follow, which will insure your success. I do not
mean that the mere formality of doing these three
things will make you safe for heaven. There is not
necessarily any virtue in the mere routine suggested.
But granting that you want to go to heaven, if you
will follow these three simple rules, they will enable
you to do what you want to do. The beauty of them
is that they are so simple that anybody can follow
them who wants to.</p>
<p>1. The first one is to read the Bible every day.
If you want to go to heaven, you are willing to do
that much, aren&rsquo;t you? If you really want to go to
heaven, won&rsquo;t you <i>want</i> to read the Bible? It&rsquo;s the
book that tells you how to get there. It is the road
map that shows you the way. If you want to go to
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
heaven, the first rule then is to read the Bible every
day. From doing that you&rsquo;ll learn what God wants
you to do in order to <i>be</i> saved and in order to <i>keep</i>
saved. The Bereans were more noble than the Thessalonians
&ldquo;because they received the word with all
readiness of mind and <i>searched the Scriptures daily</i>&rdquo;
(Acts 16:11). Now, if you don&rsquo;t read the Bible every
day, I believe you&rsquo;d have a hard time establishing
the fact that you want to go to heaven. Don&rsquo;t you
believe you would? How can you prove that you
want to go to heaven when you fail to read the only
book in the world which can tell you how to get
there?</p>
<p>I suspect that I&rsquo;m talking to two or three hundred
people right now who don&rsquo;t read the Bible daily,
and if I knew how to make this more emphatic, I&rsquo;d
do it! I&rsquo;d like to fix it so you never would forget it.
The Bible is the only book that can tell you how
to do what you propose to want to do. It is the word
which <i>God hath spoken</i>. The mere fact that you are
a member of the church is an announcement that
you want to go to heaven, but your behavior contradicts
your profession, if you do not read the Bible
every day.</p>
<p>I have found sometimes that those people who
argue the loudest and take the most dogmatic positions
on points of doctrine are the very ones who
don&rsquo;t read the Bible. They think they know! They
can tell you what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong. If you
ask them how much they read the Bible, they&rsquo;ll hang
their heads in shame and say, &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t read
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
it much.&rdquo; Sometimes they even preface their remarks
by telling you they haven&rsquo;t read it much. They say,
&ldquo;Now, preacher, I don&rsquo;t read the Bible much, and
I know you do, and so and so&rdquo; and then proceed to
tell me just exactly how it is. <i>A man who doesn&rsquo;t read
the Bible has no right to express an opinion in the
field of religion.</i> A man who begins his conversation
by saying, &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t read the Bible,&rdquo;
ought to stop right there until he has read it. He
doesn&rsquo;t have any right to talk about it, nor to undertake
to tell anybody what to do, or what one ought
to do until he has read the Bible&mdash;the only reliable
standard of right living. &ldquo;As newborn babes, desire
the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby&rdquo;
(1 Pet. 2:2). &ldquo;Receive with meekness the engrafted
word, which is able to save your souls&rdquo; (Jas.
1:21). &ldquo;Study to show thyself approved unto God ...&rdquo;
(2 Tim. 2:15).</p>
<p>If you will read the Bible every day, there is not
much that needs to be done for you; if you will not
read the Bible, there is not much that can be done
for you! Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t love the Lord well
enough to read this letter that He has written, anyone
who doesn&rsquo;t want to go to heaven bad enough
to be a daily student of God&rsquo;s word, I just can&rsquo;t see
much chance for him. One of the most alarming
things is the ignorance of our own people concerning
the Bible. Many of our own members are not daily
students of God&rsquo;s holy word. I wish I could say something
that would scare you just as much as the second
boy who fell in the grave. If I knew what to say, I&rsquo;d
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
say it. I&rsquo;d like for you to become so badly scared
that you would read the Bible every day.</p>
<p>Now, you can do it! If you don&rsquo;t read it, you cannot
blame anybody but yourself for your failure. You
say, &ldquo;But, Brother Dark, I don&rsquo;t have time.&rdquo; Oh, yes,
you do; you have as much time as anybody. There
are twenty-four hours in the day and you have all
twenty-four of them. You say, &ldquo;Yes, but I have so
many other things to do.&rdquo; Well, are those other
things as important as going to heaven? Do you love
them more than you love going to heaven? Do you
want to do them more than you want to be saved?</p>
<p>How many of you read the newspaper every day?
I suspect we would get a unanimous response on
that. How many of you listen to the radio every day?
Now, it is not wrong to listen to the radio. It&rsquo;s not
wrong to read the newspaper, maybe, but certainly
you will agree that a man who loves the newspaper
and the typical radio program more than he loves
the Lord isn&rsquo;t much interested in going to heaven.
He had rather go where they have newspapers and
radios, than to go to heaven where they have the
word of God and a choir of angels singing.</p>
<p>You see, your behavior reflects your interests. So,
you <i>can</i> read the Bible every day; and if you don&rsquo;t
do it, you can blame no one but yourself for your
failure. You can&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I tried to be a Christian and
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll just have to say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try. I
didn&rsquo;t do what I could. I didn&rsquo;t do my best.&rdquo; Sometimes
I hear people say, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done the best I
can,&rdquo; when I know they have not. I know they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
telling a falsehood when they make that statement.
Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t read the Bible daily is not
doing the best he can!</p>
<p>2. Rule Number 2 is just as simple: &ldquo;Pray every
day.&rdquo; You <i>can</i>! The Bible commands you to pray
without ceasing (Eph. 6:18). Anybody, who can talk,
can talk to God. I am afraid that there are a great
many church members who do not pray to God every
day. One cannot believe the Bible and deny the efficacy
of prayer. Prayer is powerful! Prayer moves the
hand that rules the universe. Prayer will cause God
to do things that He would not have done if you had
not prayed. Prayer is a means of drawing upon the
riches and the glory and the wisdom of God. What a
wonderful thing it is to be able to write a check on
the bank of heaven with the assurance that it will be
honored. That&rsquo;s exactly what prayer is. Through
prayer you can draw a check upon a bank whose resources
are inexhaustible, with the full assurance that
the Teller will honor the draft or check. Prayer
changes things. God will do things for you after you
have prayed that He would not have done if you
had not prayed.</p>
<p>Whatsoever ye would therefore, that God should
do unto you, ask him for it. &ldquo;Ask and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth;
and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened&rdquo; (Matt. 7:7, 8). He will
withhold no good thing from them that call upon
Him according to faith and in the name of His Son.
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
&ldquo;If ye then, being evil know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your Father
which is in heaven give good things to them that
ask him?&rdquo; (Matt. 7:11). If you haven&rsquo;t been praying
to God daily, you ought to begin to do so right now.
I heard Brother H. Leo Boles say one time that he
never even bought a pair of shoes without first asking
God to guide him in the choice that he made.
One should ask God&rsquo;s guidance in every choice, however
trivial it may seem to be. If you are not using
the power which can come to you through prayer,
then you are going along without a great blessing
that you could be enjoying. You are not doing what
you can. You can only blame yourself for the failures
that come your way.</p>
<p>3. Rule Number 3 is one that I have emphasized
here many times: &ldquo;Go to worship every time the congregation
meets.&rdquo; Be faithful and regular in your attendance
at worship. Now, you <i>can</i> do this also! Of
course, I know there are legitimate exceptions in
cases of severe sickness on your part or some member
of your family or something else of like nature; but
you know the difference between that and just staying
away because you prefer to sleep, read the paper,
listen to the radio, go fishing, take a trip, or some
other such illegitimate, unscriptural excuse.</p>
<p>You need to have the contact with other saints
upon the first day of the week. God knew what He
was doing when He arranged for us to meet together
to worship Him. He knew we would get inspiration
and encouragement there that could not be found
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
anywhere else. Whenever you show me a man who
is neglecting his church attendance, I&rsquo;ll show you a
man in the same person who is drifting away from
God. I believe there is no exception to this statement.
Whenever a man willfully stays away from worshiping
with God&rsquo;s people, he certainly drifts away from
the Lord.</p>
<p>I read a story one time about a certain family who
had been missing the worship. One of the overseers
of the church went to see this family. He went into
the room and exchanged the customary greetings;
then sat down before the open fire. He picked up
the tongs and got a red hot coal, just glowing with
heat, and laid it out on the hearth by itself. It wasn&rsquo;t
long until it cooled off and turned black. The man
of the house spoke up and said, &ldquo;Brother, you need
not say anything. We&rsquo;ll be at worship next Sunday.&rdquo;
That illustrates what happens to anybody who deliberately
stays away from worshiping God with the
saints. You can attend worship regularly; if you don&rsquo;t
you can only blame yourself for your failure. You
cannot say, &ldquo;I tried, and couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll have to
say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One time in West Virginia, I closed a meeting by
talking along this line. When I went back a year
later one of the elders got up and said, &ldquo;We had
twenty-four additions when Brother Dark was here
last year. Eighteen of them are still with us. Three
of them have moved to other towns, and three have
fallen from grace.&rdquo; I asked whether the three backsliders
had followed these three rules. Of course they
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
had not. They couldn&rsquo;t have fallen from grace if they
had been following these three rules; at least I have
never heard of anybody&rsquo;s falling who did. Have you?
I have heard of people&rsquo;s falling from grace while following
one or two of them, but not all of them.
These are not the only requirements but when faithfully
performed they make it possible and easier for
you to do your duty in every way. May I insist then,
if you want to go to heaven&mdash;and you say you do&mdash;that
you read the Bible every day, pray to God every
day, and go to worship every time you can.</p>
<p>Let me read a Scripture before I close this lesson.
It&rsquo;s found in the first chapter of 1 John 1:4. It&rsquo;s one of
the sweetest promises in all the Bible. &ldquo;These things
write we unto you, that your joy may be made full.&rdquo;
God wants us to be full of joy. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing
these things that you may be full of joy.&rdquo; Well, what
is it, John? &ldquo;This, then is the message which we have
heard of him and declare unto you, that God is light,
and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we
have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we
lie and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light
as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&rdquo; Will you
note this promise again? &ldquo;If we walk in the light as
he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
us from all sin.&rdquo; This promise is to those who walk
in the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>The word &ldquo;walk&rdquo; suggests continuation. The
blood cleanseth from all sin those who continue in
the light. Just as the word &ldquo;walk&rdquo; suggests continuation,
I believe the cleansing is also a continuing process.
The best way I know to illustrate this point is
by the blood of the human body, one purpose of
which is to remove poison from any place which
becomes infected, and eliminate the poison through
the natural channels of elimination. So the blood of
Jesus Christ flows, so to speak, through the veins of
a Christian, keeping all impurities removed therefrom.
This I believe with all my heart.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get the wrong impression. Somebody
might say, &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the way it is, I&rsquo;ll not be so
careful. I&rsquo;ll just take it easy and drift along and let
the blood of Jesus keep me clean.&rdquo; Well, it won&rsquo;t do
it in your case. You&rsquo;ve missed the point entirely. The
promise is to those who walk in the light, to those
who are doing the best they can, to those who are
working at the job, to those who really want to go to
heaven, who read the Bible, go to worship, and pray
to God, and do everything they can. In spite of all
this they&rsquo;ll make some mistakes.</p>
<p>This Scripture doesn&rsquo;t say that you won&rsquo;t sin. The
promise is to those who do sin&mdash;who sin in spite of
the fact that they are walking in the light. If people
who are walking in the light can&rsquo;t sin, then this
promise would be out of order; but this promise is
to those who are walking in the light, who are doing
the best they can, and yet they sin. When they do
so, the Bible says the blood of Jesus will cleanse
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
them from all unrighteousness&mdash;keep them clean. In
that sense, you see, you can stay in a saved condition
all the time.</p>
<p>Suppose I were to ask you right now, how many
of you believe, if you were to die at this minute, that
you would go to heaven; I wonder how many would
raise your hands. I find very few people who answer
this question properly. They say, &ldquo;Well, I hope I
would. I&rsquo;d like to. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; People go through
life in doubt about their own salvation. God didn&rsquo;t
expect his people to experience such uneasiness. He
has written these things that our joy may be full. A
lot of people have doubts and fears. They think if
they were to die just after saying their evening
prayers, confessing their sins, that they would go to
heaven, but if they were to die five minutes before,
that they would go to hell. If I felt that way about
it, I&rsquo;d want somebody to shoot me just after I&rsquo;d
finished my evening prayer so I&rsquo;d be sure to go to
heaven.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not boasting when I say that I believe with
all my heart that if I should fall dead in the midst
of this sentence, I would spend eternity in heaven.
That&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m so good; it&rsquo;s certainly not
because I have never sinned. But I <i>can</i> say this: if
there is a single sin against me of which I have not
repented, I do not know it. If I did know it, I would
repent of it before I finished this statement. I
wouldn&rsquo;t wait till time for my evening prayer. The
time to repent of a sin is just as soon as you become
aware of it, right then and there. That&rsquo;s what you
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
have to do in order to be walking in the light. Never
allow an unforgiven sin to hang over you for one
minute for you might die during that minute, and
have to spend eternity in torment.</p>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t expect his children to go through life
having so many ups and downs, thinking one minute
they&rsquo;re on their way to glory and the next minute
on their way to hell. It isn&rsquo;t necessary to be like that.
God doesn&rsquo;t want you to be. He wants you to be full
of joy. If you will read this verse, meditate upon it,
and conform to the conditions stated, it will certainly
help you to be full of joy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m emphasizing the fact that you can go to heaven
if you want to. I&rsquo;d like to read one more Scripture
and then we close. This is found in II Peter, chapter
one, verse 5-10, &ldquo;And beside this, giving all diligence; add to
your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to
knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience;
and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly
kindness; and to brotherly kindness love. For if these
things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh
these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to
make your calling and election sure.&rdquo; Do you notice
that word &ldquo;sure&rdquo;? &ldquo;Give diligence to make your calling
and election <i>sure</i>&rdquo;; it didn&rsquo;t say to make it likely,
or to make it probable, but to make it <i>certain</i>. It requires
diligence, but if you will give the proper diligence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
you can make your calling and election certain.
&ldquo;For if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man who does these things will not barely slip
in by the skin of the teeth, but for him the gates will
stand wide ajar. He will receive an abundant entrance
into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
Savior, inherit eternally a mansion which Jesus has
gone to prepare for those who love him, for those
who walk in the light, for those who do the best
they can.</p>
<p>Do you want to go to heaven? I suspect if I were
to take a vote on it and ask all who want to go to
heaven to raise their hands, that every person in the
house would raise his hand. You say you want to go,
but do you? Are you on the road which leads there?
A man driving toward Louisville, Kentucky, at sixty
miles an hour, knowing that Atlanta is in the opposite
direction, would have a hard time convincing
me that he wanted to go to Atlanta. He may want
to go some day but he doesn&rsquo;t want to go now, because
he is going in the other direction. The man
who is going toward hell at sixty minutes an hour
can&rsquo;t convince me that he wants to go to heaven,
unless he is just mistaken about his direction. Do you
really want to go to heaven? If you do, let&rsquo;s be on
the way. The Bible reveals the road which leads
there. Get up and follow the sign posts and some day
you will get there. Why not start right now? Will
you come to Jesus now?</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
